plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally the plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least 1200 & nbsp ; °c ( 2200 & nbsp ; °f ) although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced-definition televisions ( edtv ) this small , even fewer have made 32 inch plasma hdtvs though considered bulky and thick compared with their lcd counterparts , some sets such as panasonic 's z1 and samsung 's b860 series are as slim as thick making them comparable to lcds in this respect lcd as they use the same or similar phosphors as are used in crt displays , plasma 's color reproduction is very similar to that of crts unaffected by clouding from the polishing process it may cause a buzzing noise early plasma televisions were enhanced-definition ( ed ) with a native resolution of 840×480 ( discontinued ) or 853×480 , and down-scaled their incoming high-definition video signals to match their native display resolution plasmatvbuyingguide.com – edtv plasma vs mercury sheds the energy as ultraviolet ( uv ) photons the uv photons then strike phosphor that is painted on the inside of the cell when the uv photon strikes a phosphor molecule , it momentarily raises the energy level of an outer orbit electron in the phosphor molecule , moving the electron from a stable to an unstable state ; the electron then sheds the excess energy as a photon at a lower energy level than uv light ; the lower energy photons are mostly in the infrared range but about 40 % are in the visible light range the '' address electrodes '' sit behind the cells , along the rear glass plate , and can be opaque to erase a cell all voltage is removed from a pair of electrodes in color panels , the back of each cell is coated with a phosphor cnet networks – plasma vs manufacturers can further artificially improve the reported contrast ratio by increasing the contrast and brightness settings to achieve the highest test values precharging normally increases power consumption , so energy recovery mechanisms may be in place to avoid an increase in power consumption this precharging means the cells can not achieve a true black , whereas an led backlit lcd panel can actually turn off parts of the backlight , in '' spots '' or '' patches '' ( this technique , however , does not prevent the large accumulated passive light of adjacent lamps , and the reflection media , from returning values from within the panel ) some manufacturers have reduced the precharge and the associated background glow , to the point where black levels on modern plasmas are starting to become close to some high-end crts sony and mitsubishi produced ten years before the comparable plasma displays plasma displays also exhibit another image retention issue which is sometimes confused with screen burn-in damage plasma screens use significantly more energy than crt and lcd screens the first practical plasma video display was co-invented in 1964 at the university of illinois at urbana–champaign by donald bitzer , h nonetheless , the plasma displays ' relatively large screen size and 1 & nbsp ; inch thickness made them suitable for high-profile placement in lobbies and stock exchanges due to heavy competition from monochrome lcds used in laptops of the era and the high costs of plasma display technology , in 1987 ibm planned to shut down its factory in upstate new york , the largest plasma plant in the world , in favor of manufacturing mainframe computers , which would have left development to japanese companies 2 , ( april , 2006 ) , pp.268-278 4 , june 15 , 1997 , retrieved 2009-01-29 by the year 2000 prices had dropped to 10,000 in the year 2000 , the first 60-inch plasma display was developed by plasmaco , & el khiati , n '' lcd televisions outsell plasma 8 to 1 worldwide '' , digital home , 21 may 2008 , retrieved 2008-06-13 however , improvements in vlsi fabrication narrowed the technological gap , '' 6ft by 150 inches – and that 's just the tv '' , the independent , 8 january 2008 , retrieved 2009-01-29 at the 2010 consumer electronics show in las vegas , panasonic introduced their 152 '' 2160p 3d plasma in 2010 , the shipments of plasma tvs reached 18.2 million units globally panasonic , samsung and lg were the last plasma manufacturers for the u.s plasma display panels : the colorful history of an illinois technology ' ' by jamie hutchinson , electrical and computer engineering alumni news , winter 2002–2003 ( via archive.org ) nytimes.com – forget l.c.d ; go for plasma , says maker of both according to panasonic corporation home theater geeks – 13 : plasma geek out ( audio podcast )
