a higher mechanical compression ratio , or dynamic compression ratio with forced induction , can be used to improve thermodynamic efficiency this in turn results in a high-quality combustion of the much weaker mixture elsewhere in the cylinder comparison with diesel engine in earlier manufactured editions the external characteristics were obvious in the conventional four-stroke petrol engine the spark plug commences to ignite the mixture in the cylinder at up to forty degrees before top dead centre while the piston is still travelling up the bore at this point maximum cylinder pressure has been reached brayton describes his invention as follows : '' i have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder , or in a communicating firing chamber '' another part reads '' i have for the first time , so far as my knowledge extends , regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion '' the cvcc system had conventional inlet and exhaust valves and a third , supplementary , inlet valve that charged an area around the spark plug jaguar cars in the 1980s developed the jaguar v12 engine , h.e ( so called high efficiency ) version , which fit in the jaguar xj12 and jaguar xjs models and used a stratified charge design called the 'may fireball ' in order to reduce the engine 's very heavy fuel consumption volkswagen currently uses stratified charge on its direct injection 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.5 , 1.8 and 2.0 litres tfsi ( turbo fuel stratified injection ) gasoline engines , in combination with turbocharging mercedes benz has been employing stratified charge engines with its blue direct system some advantages of tfsi engines : better fuel distribution and better fuel charge inside the combustion chamber during the injection process the fuel gets evaporated , cooling the cylinder chamber cooling effect of the pressurized fuel allows for use of a lower octane fuel leading to a cost savings for the end user higher compression ratios , which translates into more power increased fuel combustion efficiency higher power during pick-up of vehicle
