further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) when the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous ( flat ) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and , like defecation , subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued , neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally , causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons new law of urination : mammals take 20 seconds to pee , carrie arnold , national geographic , 23 october 2013 this is due to increased urethra length of large animals , which amplifies gravitational force ( hence flow rate ) , and increased urethra width , which increases flow rate another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center , which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter there is another facilitatory area in the posterior hypothalamus however , stimulation experiments in animals indicate that other cortical areas also affect the process the external sphincter can be contracted voluntarily , which will prevent urine from passing down the urethra in many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder , even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself , and can be felt there as well many clinical conditions can cause disturbances to normal urination , including : urinary incontinence , the inability to hold urine stress incontinence , incontinence as a result of external mechanical disturbances urge incontinence , incontinence that occurs as a result of the uncontrollable urge to urinate mixed incontinence , a combination of the two types of incontinence urinary retention , the inability to initiate urination overactive bladder , a strong urge to urinate , usually accompanied by detrusor overactivity interstitial cystitis , a condition characterized by urinary frequency , urgency , and pain prostatitis , an inflammation of the prostate gland that can cause urinary frequency , urgency , and pain benign prostatic hyperplasia , an enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary frequency , urgency , retention , and the dribbling of urine urinary tract infection , which can cause urinary frequency and dysuria polyuria , abnormally large production of urine , associated with , in particular , diabetes mellitus ( types 1 and 2 ) , and diabetes insipidus oliguria , low urine output , usually due to a problem with the upper urinary tract anuria refers to absent or almost absent urine output bladder sphincter dyssynergia , a discoordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter as a result of brain or spinal cord injury a drug that increases urination is called a diuretic , whereas antidiuretics decrease the production of urine by the kidneys in all three types the bladder contracts , but the contractions are generally not sufficient to empty the viscus completely , and residual urine is left in the bladder as these people may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals directly adjacent to another person gradually , however , the muscle of the '' decentralized bladder '' becomes active , with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra it becomes overfilled , and urine dribbles through the sphincters ( overflow incontinence ) some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs , provoking a mild mass reflex the amniotic fluid is then recycled by fetal swallowing . social and cultural aspects review of medical physiology , twentieth edition , william f examples ( depending on circumstances ) include activities such as camping , hiking , cross country running , rural fishing , amateur baseball , golf , etc one proposed way to inhibit public urination due to drunkenness is the urilift , which is disguised as a normal manhole by day but raises out of the ground at night to provide a public restroom for bar-goers women and the u.s constitution : history , interpretation , and practice schwarzenbach , patricia smith , columbia university press , new york female urination devices are available to help women to urinate discreetly , as well to help them urinate while standing standing versus sitting or squatting a literature review found cultural differences in socially accepted voiding positions around the world and found differences in preferred position : in the middle-east and asia , the squatting position was more prevalent , while in the western world the standing and sitting positions were more common if there is no toilet available then a squatting or a half squat position is common for example , centuries ago the standard english word ( both noun and verb , for the product and the activity ) was '' piss '' , but subsequently '' pee '' , formerly associated with children , has become more common in general public speech other expressions include '' squirting '' and '' taking a leak '' , and , predominantly by younger persons for outdoor female urination , '' popping a squat '' , referring to the position many women adopt in such circumstances references to urination are commonly used in slang urination and sexual activity drinking urine is known as urophagia , though uraphagia refers to the consumption of urine regardless of whether the context is sexual kick ( 2001

into the face of the male some animals ' ( example : carnivores ' ) urine possesses a strong odour , especially when it is used to mark territory or stallions sometimes exhibit the flehmen response by
