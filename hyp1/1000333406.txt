however , if a solid surface is placed close , and approximately parallel to the jet ( diagram 2 ) , then the entrainment ( and therefore removal ) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that can not be balanced as rapidly as the low pressure region on the '' open '' side of the jet retrieved 17 november 2017 if the surface is not too sharply curved , the jet can , under the right circumstances , adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface , and thus travel in a direction opposite to its initial direction on the right image , the effect occurs along the curved wall as a wall jet a coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment : a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9° , followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer , subject to this positive longitudinal gradient , illusions créatrices , createspace & kindle,2015 , ch 8 , coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs , and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution : the calculated pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above , outside the nozzle according to van dyke , m again a solution exists for any value of the relative curvature and angle θ the surface pressure distribution is then calculated using bernoulli equation then the velocity is found to be : : \frac\bigg ) \bigg ] an image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of the relative curvature h/r , and the same angle θ as those found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established : it may be found in reference ( 15 ) p the surface pressure distribution as well as the reattachment distance have been duly measured in both cases , and two approximate theories have been developed for the mean pressure within the separation bubble , the position of reattachment and the increase in volume flow from the orifice : the agreement with experiment was satisfactory closely following the work of coandă on applications of his research , and in particular the work on his '' aerodina lenticulară , '' fluid dynamics by mihaela-maria tanasescu , texas tech university john frost of avro canada also spent considerable time researching the effect , leading to a series of '' inside out '' hovercraft-like aircraft from which the air exited in a ring around the outside of the aircraft and was directed by being '' attached '' to a flap-like ring yenne 2003 , pp the avrocar intended to exploit the coandă effect to provide lift and thrust from a single '' turborotor '' blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk-shaped aircraft to provide anticipated vtol-like performance army tactical combat aircraft requirement milberry 1979 , p us air force 's 1950s supersonic flying saucer declassified project documents remained classified until 2012 the effect was also implemented during the u.s the addition of these two systems gives the aircraft an impressive stol capability image : notar system.svg thumb left 300 px a coandă engine ( items 3,6–8 ) replaces the tail rotor in the notar helicopter this project utilized a particular symmetric nozzle to produce an effective modeling of the coandă effect , trancossi m '' the international journal of multiphysics 8.2 ( 2014 ) : 181–202 subhash , maharshi , and antonio dumas trancossi , michele , et al name '' das , shyam s '' journal of aerospace engineering 29.1 ( 2015 ) : 04015015 incas bull , 6 ( 3 ) , 35–41 notes regarding the definition and applicability of supercirculation due to the slope , the debris falls from the screens without mechanical clearing , and due to the wires of the screen optimizing the coandă effect , the water flows through the screen to the penstocks leading the water to the turbines '' instrument society of america , 1990 in air conditioning , the coandă effect is exploited to increase the throw of a ceiling mounted diffuser fluidics , the coandă effect , and some orographic winds the coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a coandă effect mixer ( mclean in '' understanding aerodynamics '' '' understanding aerodynamics arguing from the real physics '' doug mclean , 2013 , john wiley & sons ltd a waste basket works well those problems and how different spins couple have been analyzed in depth .
