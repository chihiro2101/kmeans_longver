smoke rising from a cigarette flow over a golf ball most of the terrestrial atmospheric circulation these layers separate the fast moving jet from the external fluid , and at a certain critical reynolds number they become unstable and break down to turbulence bridge supports ( piers ) in water the turbulent events are associated with coherent flow structures such as eddies and turbulent bursting , and they play a critical role in terms of sediment scour , accretion and transport in rivers as well as contaminant mixing and dispersion in rivers and estuaries , and in the atmosphere ferziger , joel h computational methods for fluid dynamics germany : springer-verlag berlin heidelberg for instance , in large bodies of water like oceans this coefficient can be found using richardson 's four-third power law and is governed by the random walk principle ; cohen , ira m netherlands : elsevier inc turbulent flows may be viewed as made of an entire hierarchy of eddies over a wide range of length scales and the hierarchy can be described by the energy spectrum that measures the energy in flow velocity fluctuations for each length scale ( wavenumber ) ; integral time scale the integral time scale for a lagrangian flow can be defined as : : t \left ( \frac \ , , since the experimental values obtained for the second order structure function only deviate slightly from the value predicted by kolmogorov theory , the value for is very near to ( differences are about 2 % ) thus the '' kolmogorov âˆ’ spectrum '' is generally observed in turbulence
