american inventor james t analog to digital to optical photographic recording and playback system , march 1970 russell 's patent application was first filed in 1966 , and he was granted a patent in 1970 despite costing up to 1,000 , over 400,000 cd players were sold in the united states between 1983 and 1984 . digital audio laser-disc prototypes in 1974 , l ottens , director of the audio division of philips , started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record sony 's aes technical paper was published on 1 march 1979 after a year of experimentation and discussion , the task force produced the red book cd-da standard the compact disc story , told by a former member of the task force , gives background information on the many technical decisions made , including the choice of the sampling frequency , playing time , and disc diameter philips established the polydor pressing operations plant in langenhagen near hannover , germany , and quickly passed a series of milestones the first test pressing was of a recording of richard strauss 's an alpine symphony ( an alpine symphony ) played by the berlin philharmonic and conducted by herbert von karajan , who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979 the first public demonstration was on the bbc television program tomorrow 's world in 1981 , when the bee gees ' album living eyes ( 1981 ) was played it was a recording from 1979 of claudio arrau performing chopin waltzes ( philips 400 025-2 ) the japanese launch was followed in march 1983 by the introduction of cd players and discs to europe '' philips celebrates 25th anniversary of the compact disc '' , philips media release , 16 august 2007 the new audio disc was enthusiastically received , especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities , and its handling quality received particular praise pp 19-21 glenn baddeley november 1989 news update melbourne audio club inc . further development and decline the cd was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music , rather than primarily as a data storage medium , but from its origins as a format for music , its use has grown to encompass other applications the world 's first cd-r was made by the japanese firm taiyo yuden co some cd players incorporate disc changers they were often built into car audio and home stereo systems , although a 7 disc cd changer was once made by nec for pcs an electric motor spins the disc the tracking control is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized , processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track , do the skip and seek functions and display track , time , index and , on newer players in the 2010s , display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel analogue signal recovery from the disc on most players , the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes the efm demodulator also decodes part of the cd signal and routes it to the proper circuits , separating audio , parity and control ( subcode ) data although the sony prototype design was never put into volume production , the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early japanese cd player manufacturers , including luxman , matsushita under the technics brand , kenwood and toshiba for the early vertical loading players , alpine sourced their ad-7100 player designs for luxman , kenwood and toshiba ( using their aurex brand ) some cd players combine vertical loading with slot loading due to the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes the top-loading disc tray design is also used in most fifth-generation video game consoles ( the playstation , the sega saturn and the 3do interactive multiplayer ) , as well as the sega dreamcast , the nintendo gamecube and the wii mini tray loading with sliding mechanism the meridians 200 and 203 players were of this type non-circular cds can not be used on such loaders because they can not handle non-circular discs the swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a hard drive moves its head across the data tracks philips cd100 service manual the linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field sony cdp-101 service manual ) the tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded , and the lens assembly reads the information using a laser beam produced by a laser diode yet others are related to the cd player 's intended target , such as anti-skip for car and portable cd players , pitch control and queuing for a dj 's cd player , remote and system integration for household players a portable cd player is a portable audio player used to play compact discs the d-50 was made available on the market in 1984 , and adopted for sony 's entire portable cd player line most boomboxes were battery-operated , leading to extremely heavy , bulky boxes disc jockeys ( djs ) who are playing a mix of songs at a dance club , rave , or nightclub create their dance mixes by having songs playing on two or more sound sources and using a dj mixer to transition seamlessly between songs university of california press , 2010
