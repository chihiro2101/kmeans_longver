new soils can also deepen from dust deposition the soils found on mesas , plateaux , and plains are residual soils in the united states as little as three percent of the soils are residual most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind , water , ice and gravity water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial , lacustrine , or marine retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases , outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier while peat may form sterile soils , muck soils may be very fertile chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of organic acids and chelating compounds by bacteria and fungi , thought to increase under present-day greenhouse effect water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock , while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of '' shells '' grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation this results in soluble acid-base pairs for example , the hydrolysis of orthoclase-feldspar transforms it to acid silicate clay and basic potassium hydroxide , both of which are more soluble in carbonation , the solution of carbon dioxide in water forms carbonic acid often called weathered granite , saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include : hydrolysis , chelation from organic compounds , hydration ( the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs ) and physical processes that include freezing and thawing climate is the dominant factor in soil formation , and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the climate zones in which they form , with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere according to the climatic determination of biomes , humid climates favor the growth of trees the greater the depth of water penetration , the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development thus , percolating water stimulates weathering reactions and helps differentiate soil horizons the effectiveness of water in weathering parent rock material depends on seasonal and daily temperature fluctuations , which favour tensile stresses in rock minerals , and thus their mechanical disaggregation , a process called thermal fatigue the topography , or relief , is characterized by the inclination ( slope ) , elevation , and orientation of the terrain steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by erosion and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence , little mineral deposition in lower profiles soils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes , and soils on the slopes that face the sun path will be drier than soils on slopes that do not these patterns emerge from topographic differences in erosion , deposition , fertility , soil moisture , plant cover , other soil biology , fire-history , and exposure to the elements animals serve to decompose plant materials and mix soil through bioturbation there may be a population limit of around one billion cells per gram of soil , but estimates of the number of species vary widely from 50,000 per gram to over a million per gram of soil soil animals , including soil macrofauna and soil mesofauna , mix soils as they form burrows and pores , allowing moisture and gases to move about , a process called bioturbation mucilage colonies to which clay particles are glued , offering them a protection against desiccation and predation by soil microfauna ( bacteriophagous protozoa and nematodes ) humans impact soil formation by removing vegetation cover with erosion , waterlogging , lateritization or podzolization ( according to climate and topography ) as the result in addition , as ants and termites build mounds , they transport soil materials from one horizon to another old animal burrows in the lower horizons often become filled with soil material from the overlying a horizon , creating profile features known as crotovinas it can prevent erosion caused by excessive rain that might result from surface runoff plants can form new chemicals that can break down minerals , both directly and indirectly through mycorrhizal fungi and rhizosphere bacteria , and improve the soil structure soil factors such as density , depth , chemistry , ph , temperature and moisture greatly affect the type of plants that can grow in a given location there , organisms feed on them and mix the organic material with the upper soil layers ; these added organic compounds become part of the soil formation process for example , it is believed that native americans regularly set fires to maintain several large areas of prairie grasslands in indiana and michigan , although climate and mammalian grazers ( e.g likewise , irrigation soil in an arid region drastically influences soil-forming factors , as does adding fertilizer and lime to soils of low fertility this outcome was not anticipated because the antecedent prairie fire ecology capable of producing these distinct deep rich black soils is not easily observed time is a factor in the interactions of all the above for example , recently deposited material from a flood exhibits no soil development as there has not been enough time for the material to form a structure that further defines soil since hans jenny published his formulation in 1941 , it has been used by innumerable soil surveyors all over the world as a qualitative list for understanding the factors that may be important for producing the soil pattern within a region soils can be enriched by deposition of sediments on floodplains and alluvial fans , and by wind-borne deposits pedoturbation includes vertisol , cryoturbation , and bioturbation a specific example of the evolution of soils in prehistoric lake beds is in the makgadikgadi pans of the kalahari desert , where change in an ancient river course led to millennia of salinity buildup and formation of calcretes and silcretes
