. birds and bird-pollinated flowers hummingbirds and ornithophilous ( bird-pollinated ) flowers have evolved a mutualistic relationship it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects the prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous ( insect-pollinated ) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers . acacia ants and acacias the acacia ant ( pseudomyrmex ferruginea ) is an obligate plant ant that protects at least five species of '' acacia '' ( vachellia ) from preying insects and from other plants competing for sunlight , and the tree provides nourishment and shelter for the ant and its larvae these cheater ants impose important host costs via damage to tree reproductive organs , though their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and , thus , becomes difficult to forecast parasites and sexually reproducing hosts host–parasite coevolution is the coevolution of a host and a parasite it seems that when a parasite infects a host , sexual reproduction affords a better chance of developing resistance ( through variation in the next generation ) , giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction , which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite these birds do not make their own nests , but lay their eggs in nests of other species , ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host 's reproductive fitness the queens are unable to produce worker ants by mating with their own species only by crossbreeding can they produce workers these often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator , resulting in anti-predator adaptations the squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales , whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles this is not always the case for instance , a trait in several species of flowering plant , such as offering its nectar at the end of a long tube , can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects , such as a long proboscis juenger , thomas , and joy bergelson '' evolution ( 1998 ) : 1583–1592 when detrimental , natural selection will favor evolutionary responses in the host population , resulting in a coevolutionary hotspot of ongoing reciprocal evolutionary changes in the parasite and host populations , the design and computational model of cooperative coevolution , phd thesis , george mason university , fairfax , virginia , 1997 '' valeur later argued that : '' as we become more and more interconnected and interdependent , human development is no longer a matter of the evolution of individual groups of people but rather a matter of the co-evolution of all people '' at the school of architecture , planning and landscape , newcastle university , a coevolutionary approach to architecture has been defined as a design practice that engages students , volunteers and members of the local community in practical , experimental work aimed at '' establishing dynamic processes of learning between users and designers in cosmology and astronomy in his book the self-organizing universe , erich jantsch attributed the entire evolution of the cosmos to coevolution in astronomy , an emerging theory proposes that black holes and galaxy develop in an interdependent way analogous to biological coevolution even so , abatecola el al changes in hardware , an operating system or web browser may introduce new features that are then incorporated into the corresponding applications running alongside coevolution , video of lecture by stephen c
