however , there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind , which deny multiple realizability indeed , one of hilary putnam 's putnam , hilary ( later published as '' the nature of mental states '' in putnam ( 1975a ) the first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by hilary putnam in the 1960s putnam himself , by the mid-1970s , had begun questioning this position typically , a turing machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right these are the inputs to the machine an extremely simple example of a turing machine which writes out the sequence '111 ' after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table : this table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square ( b ) , it will print a 1 and remain in state one if it is in state one and reads a 1 , it will move one square to the right and also go into state two the essential point to consider here is the nature of the states of the turing machine “ the mental life of some machines , ” in h.-n ) , intentionality , minds , and perception detroit , mi : wayne state university press , pp this view is most closely associated with jerry fodor and zenon pylyshyn and has been labeled psycho-functionalism homuncular functionalism was developed largely by daniel dennett and has been advocated by william lycan whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis , it was immediately objected that it entailed an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience : the systemic mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the chinese nation , to stick to block 's formulation given the transitivity of supervenience , if m1 supervenes on m2 , and m2 supervenes on p ( physical base ) , then m1 and m2 both supervene on p , even though they are ( allegedly ) totally different sets of mental facts since mind-mind supervenience seemed to have become acceptable in functionalist circles , it seemed to some that the only way to resolve the puzzle was to postulate the existence of an entire hierarchical series of mind levels ( analogous to homunculi ) which became less and less sophisticated in terms of functional organization and physical composition all the way down to the level of the physico-mechanical neuron or group of neurons in hunneman ( ed ) functions : selection and mechanisms dordrecht : kluwer , pp.159-81 mechanistic functionalism leads functionalism away from the traditional functionalist autonomy of psychology from neuroscience and towards integrating psychology and neuroscience by providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data , mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works '' troubles with functionalism '' , in ( 1980a ) according to functionalism , so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles , with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs , the system will be a real mind , with mental states , consciousness , and so on further suppose that the people outside of the room are chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the chinese symbols in connection with block 's chinese nation , many functionalists responded to searle 's thought experiment by suggesting that there was a form of mental activity going on at a higher level than the man in the chinese room could comprehend ( the so-called '' system reply '' ) ; that is , the system does know chinese another main criticism of functionalism is the inverted spectrum or inverted qualia scenario , most specifically proposed as an objection to functionalism by ned block block , ned and fodor , j this thought experiment involves supposing that there is a person , call her jane , that is born with a condition which makes her see the opposite spectrum of light that is normally perceived unlike normal people , jane sees the color violet as yellow , orange as blue , and so forth oxford : blackwell david chalmers tries to show chalmers , david consequently , crabb argues , chalmers ' '' fading qualia '' and '' dancing qualia '' arguments fail to establish that cases of permanently inverted or absent qualia are nomologically impossible '' the meaning of 'meaning , reprinted in putnam ( 1975a ) since no one has yet been able to formulate a clear basis or justification for the existence of such a distinction in mental contents , however , this idea has generally been abandoned in favor of externalist causal theories of mental contents ( also known as informational semantics ) but since these outputs are , according to functionalism , related to many ( if not all ) internal mental states , two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little ( perhaps nothing ) in common in any of their mental states formulations of functionalism which stipulate absolute requirements on interaction with external objects ( external to the functional account , meaning not defined functionally ) are reduced to behaviorism instead of absolute triviality , because the input-output behavior is still required furthermore , constraining the mappings seems to require either consideration of the external behavior as in behaviorism , or discussion of the internal structure of the realization as in identity theory ;
