this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia several years later , another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight , gy in the monkeys , the striate cortex of the left hemisphere was surgically removed a 2011 study found that a young woman with a unilateral lesion of area v1 could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field , even though she could not report the sizes of the objects he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field the normal techniques that were used to assess visual acuity in humans involved asking them to verbally describe some visually recognizable aspect of an object or objects db themselves chalked up the accuracy of their guesses to be merely coincidental previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement however one of the subjects was not able to accurately determine whether or not blue dots were moving regardless of the brightness contrast , but he/she was able to do so with every other color dot the study showed that even without the ability to be visually aware of a stimulus the participant could still focus his/her attention on this object he had two successive strokes , which knocked out the region in both his left and right hemispheres to the researchers ' delight , he moved around every obstacle with ease , at one point even pressing himself up against the wall to squeeze past a trashcan placed in his way the girl 's grandfather , mr the neuropsychologist , dr , performed an exercise with him to a chair , had him sit down , and then asked to borrow his cane i know that you can see a little bit straight ahead of you , and i do n't want you to use that piece of vision for what i 'm going to ask you to do after this , mr after this , the doctor said , '' good '' the doctor then rotated the cane 90 degrees , so that the handle was oriented vertically the doctor then asked mr to reach for the cane again destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation visual processing occurs in the brain in a hierarchical series of stages ( with much crosstalk and feedback between areas ) this information moves through an area of the brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus , located in the thalamus , and on to be processed in the primary visual cortex , area v1 ( also known as the striate cortex because of its striped appearance ) mosby 's dictionary of medicine , nursing & health professions defines the lgn as '' one of two elevations of the lateral posterior thalamus receiving visual impulses from the retina via the optic nerves and tracts and relaying the impulses to the calcarine ( visual ) cortex '' from the optic disc , visual information travels through the optic nerve and into the optic chiasm according to schmid et al this information was found through experiments using fmri during activation and inactivation of the lgn and the contribution the lgn has on visual experience in monkeys with a v1 lesion evidence also suggests that , following a traumatic injury to v1 , there is still a direct pathway from the retina through the lgn to the extrastriate visual areas in non-human primates , these often include v2 , v3 , and v4 in a study conducted in primates , after partial ablation of area v1 , areas v2 and v3 were still excited by visual stimulus visual agnosia riddoch syndrome
