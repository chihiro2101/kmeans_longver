however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering pincus , edward and ascher , steven the filmmaker 's handbook for ntsc , the difference in frame rates can be corrected by showing every fourth frame of film twice , although this does require the sound to be handled separately to avoid '' skipping '' effects to avoid the synchronization issues , higher-end establishments now use a scanning system rather than just a telecine system this allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film , providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve in countries that use the pal or secam video standards , film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second while this is usually not noticed in the picture ( but may be more noticeable during action speed , especially if footage was filmed undercranked ) , the 4 % increase in playback speed causes a slightly noticeable increase in audio pitch by about 0.707 semitones , which is sometimes corrected using a pitch shifter , though pitch shifting is a recent innovation and supersedes an alternative method of telecine for 25 frame/s formats 2:2 pulldown is also used to transfer shows and films , photographed at 30 frames per second , like friends and oklahoma ! ( 1955 ) , to ntsc video , which has ~59.94 & nbsp ; hz scanning rate this requires playback speed to be slowed by a tenth of a percent although the 4 % speed increase has been standard since the early days of pal and secam television , recently a new technique has gained popularity , and the resulting speed and pitch of the telecined presentation are identical to that of the original film mainframe entertainment used a novel process for its tv shows in the case of pal dvds using 2:2 pulldown , the difference between soft and hard telecine vanishes , and the two may be regarded as equal
