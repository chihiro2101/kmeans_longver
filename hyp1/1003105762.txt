desmostylians were large , fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails in adults , the joints between the radius and ulna prevent any movements their name refers to their highly distinctive molars , in which each cusp was modified into hollow columns , so a typical molar would have resembled a cluster of pipes , or in the case of worn molars , volcanoes ) desmostylus did not chew or eat like any other known animal desmostylians are believed to be aquatic because of a combination of characteristics based on a comparison of trunk and limb proportions , concluded that desmostylians were more terrestrial than aquatic and clearly fore limb-dominated swimmers , hence they were more similar to '' sea bears '' than '' sea sloths '' ( as proposed by other researchers they range from the early oligocene to the late miocene photos : new species of extinct marine mammal identified from unalaska fossils , alaska dispatch news , mike dunham , october 7 , 2015 douglas emlong 's 1971 discovery of the new genus behemotops from oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones proposed a new classification of paleoparadoxiidae : order desmostylia reinhart , 1953 family paleoparadoxiidae reinhart , 1959 subfamily behemotopsinae ( inuzuka , 1987 ) behemotops domning , ray , and mckenna , 1986 behemotops proteus domning , ray , and mckenna , 1986 ( including behemotops emlongi domning , ray , and mckenna , 1986 ) behemotops katsuiei inuzuka , 2000b subfamily paleoparadoxiinae ( reinhart , 1959 ) archaeoparadoxia archaeoparadoxia weltoni ( clark , 1991 ) paleoparadoxia reinhart , 1959 paleoparadoxia tabatai ( tokunaga , 1939 ) , ( paleoparadoxia media inuzuka , 2005 ) neoparadoxia barnes 2013 neoparadoxia repenningi ( domning and barnes , 2007 ) neoparadoxia cecilialina barnes 2013
