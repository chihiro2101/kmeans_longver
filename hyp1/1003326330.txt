( simon , 1839 ) , p ) by 1845 , the german chemist august hofmann and his student john blyth had determined styrene 's empirical formula : c 8 h 8 reprinted in : ; see p ( blyth and hofmann , 1845a ) , p '' ( one knows that styrene when heated in a sealed vessel at 200 & nbsp ; °c , for several hours , is changed into a resinous polymer ( metastyrol ) , and that this polymer , when distilled abruptly , reproduces styrene '' ( i think that henceforth one will have to replace the word '' styrol '' with that of '' cinnamène '' , and '' metastyrol '' with '' metacinnamène '' however , the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin : the latter was optical rotation 160 : '' 1° le carbure des cinnamates est privé de pouvoir rotatoire , tandis que le carbure du styrax dévie de 3 degrés la teinte de passage ( l 100 mm ) the carbon atom of cinnamates is bereft of rotary power i.e for further details about 19th century polarimeters , see : ) eventually , in 1876 , the dutch chemist van 't hoff resolved the ambiguity : the optical activity of the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin was due to a contaminant van 't hoff , j ( 1876 ) '' die identität von styrol und cinnamol , ein neuer körper aus styrax '' ( the identity of styrol and cinnamol , a new substance from styrax ) , berichte der deutschen chemischen gesellschaft , 9 : 5-6 this hydroperoxide is then used to oxidize propylene to propylene oxide , which is also recovered as a co-product . from benzene and ethane ethane , along with ethylbenzene , is fed to a dehydrogenation reactor with a catalyst capable of simultaneously producing styrene and ethylene development of the process is ongoing this is known as autopolymerisation , and will take place at ambient temperatures and above the autopolymerisation reaction can only be kept in check by the continuous addition of polymerisation inhibitors on 10 june 2011 , the national toxicology program has described styrene as '' reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen '' they concluded , '' the findings have to be interpreted with caution , due to the company based exposure assessment , but the possible association between exposures in the reinforced plastics industry , mainly styrene , and degenerative disorders of the nervous system and pancreatic cancer , deserves attention '' thirteen people reportedly died and over 200 people were hospitalized .
