hard links do not link paths on different volumes or file system , whereas symbolic links may point to any file or directory irrespective of the volumes on which the link and target reside symbolic links operate transparently for many operations : programs that read or write to files named by a symbolic link will behave as if operating directly on the target file posix and unix-like operating systems the ln shell command normally uses the link link , linkat ieee std 1003.1 , 2013 edition symlinks were introduced in 4.2bsd unix from u.c the rm ( delete file ) command , however , removes the link itself , not the target file storage of symbolic links the original style is retronym a slow symlink although storing the link value inside the inode saves a disk block and a disk read , the operating system still needs to parse the path name in the link , which always requires reading additional inodes and generally requires reading other , and potentially many , directories , processing both the list of files and the inodes of each of them until it finds a match with the link 's path components some operating systems , such as freebsd , offer the ability to modify file permissions and filesystem attributes of a symbolic link , through lchmod and lchflags system calls respectively it was included with windows xp , but was only enabled by default for kernel mode programs ; windows vista and later versions of windows enabled support for symbolic links to user mode applications , as well , and supplied the command line utility mklink for creating them createsymboliclink function , msdn library , win32 and com development windows 7 and vista support a maximum of 31 reparse points ( and therefore symbolic links ) for a given path ( i.e is often used in scripts to determine the actual current working directory when any path is used with a system call , any use of will use the actual filesystem parent of the directory containing the pseudo-directory entry so , and may return completely different results ps > mklink /d '' env : localappdata\plex media server '' '' g : \plex media server '' ps > new-item -path c : \targetpath -itemtype symboliclink -value f : \sourcepath the windows 2000 version of ntfs introduced reparse points , which enabled , among other things , the use of volume mount points and junction points shortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file system and by software programs that are not aware of them , in an archive file that can be unpacked anywhere ) variables embedded in a symbolic link may include user and environment specific information pyramid technology 's osx operating system implemented conditional symbolic links which pointed to different locations depending on which universe a program was running in whereas if the ps command was run in the ucb universe , then /bin would point to /.ucbbin and /.ucbbin/ps would be executed symlink race & mdash ; a security-vulnerability caused by symbolic links freedup & mdash ; generates links between identical data automatically
