ground waves are less important beyond several hundred to a thousand miles , and the main mode of long distance propagation is an earth-ionosphere waveguide mechanism : : this is because vlf waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere , while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to earth from higher layers in the ionosphere , the f1 and f2 layers , by a refraction process , and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere , so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence propagation distances of 5,000–20,000 & nbsp ; km have been realized the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies this is accomplished with a saturable reactor in series with the antenna loading coil therefore only text data can be transmitted , at low bit rates vlf antennas typically operate '' voltage-limited '' , with the voltage on the antenna close to the limit that the insulation will stand , so they will not tolerate any abrupt change in the voltage or current from the transmitter without arcing or other insulation problems the three types of modulation that have been used in vlf transmitters are : ; continuous wave ( cw ) , interrupted continuous wave ( icw ) , or on-off keying : morse code radiotelegraphy transmission with unmodulated carrier to avoid arcing , fsk can only be used at slow rates of 50–75 & nbsp ; bit/s if the two frequencies representing ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' are 50 & nbsp ; hz apart , the standard frequency shift used in military vlf stations , their phases coincide every 20 & nbsp ; ms navigation beacons and time signals the wwvl service was discontinued in july & nbsp ; 1972 geophysical and atmospheric measurement naturally occurring signals in the vlf band are used by geophysicists for long range lightning location and for research into atmospheric phenomena such as the aurora measurements of whistlers are employed to infer the physical properties of the magnetosphere geophysicists use vlf-electromagnetic receivers to measure conductivity in the near surface of the earth examples of naval vlf transmitters are britain 's skelton transmitting station in skelton , cumbria germany 's dho38 in rhauderfehn , which transmits on 23.4 & nbsp ; khz with a power of 800 & nbsp ; kw u.s submarine and subterranean communications high power land-based and aircraft transmitters in countries that operate submarines send signals that can be received thousands of miles away submarines receive signals from land based and aircraft transmitters using some form of towed antenna that floats just under the surface of the water – for example a buoyant cable array antenna ( bcaa ) modern receivers use sophisticated digital signal processing techniques to remove the effects of atmospheric noise ( largely caused by lightning strikes around the world ) and adjacent channel signals , extending the useful reception range vlf can also penetrate soil and rock for some distance , so these frequencies are also used for through-the-earth mine communications systems operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 & nbsp ; khz , 6.47 & nbsp ; khz , 5.17 & nbsp ; khz , and 2.97 & nbsp ; khz transmissions typically last from one hour up to several days and both receiver and transmitter must have their frequency locked to a stable reference such as a gps disciplined oscillator or a rubidium standard in order to support such long duration coherent detection and decoding these spectrograms show many signals , which may include vlf transmitters and the horizontal electron beam deflection of tv sets for a more detailed list , see list of vlf-transmitters pc-based vlf-reception gallery of vlf-signals nasa live streaming elf - > vlf receiver note : as of 05/03/2014 , the '' listen live '' links are down , but the site has some previously recorded examples to listen to
