during world war i , with the scarcity of phosphate dung , earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates a complete skeleton , five complete skulls , and 18 & nbsp ; other bones were found inside jaskinia niedźwiedzia ( bear cave ) in 1966 in poland the immediate precursor of the cave bear was probably ursus deningeri ( deninger 's bear ) , a species restricted to pleistocene europe about 1.8 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago this study confirmed and built on results from a previous study using mitochondrial dna extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old its stout body had long thighs , massive shins and in-turning feet , making it similar in skeletal structure to the brown bear the femora of male cave bears , however , bore more similarities in size to those of kodiak bears pinto llona , a & etxeberrı´a , p the morphological features of the cave bear chewing apparatus , including loss of premolars , have long been suggested to indicate their diets displayed a higher degree of herbivory than the eurasian brown bear indeed , a solely vegetarian diet has been inferred on the basis of tooth morphology for example , toothmarks on cave bear remains in areas where cave bears are the only recorded potential carnivores suggests occasional cannibalistic scavenging , possibly on individuals that died during hibernation , and dental microwear analysis indicates the cave bear may have fed on a greater quantity of bone than its contemporary , the smaller eurasian brown bear 2003 : isotopic biogeochemistry and the paleoecology of the mammoth steppe fauna & de vos , j cave hyenas are thought to be responsible for the disarticulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons the cave bear 's range stretched across europe ; from spain and great britain in the west , italy , parts of germany , poland , the balkans , romania and parts of russia , including the caucasus ; and northern iran between the years 1917 and 1923 , the drachenloch cave in switzerland was excavated by emil bächler insoll states that the evidence for religious practices involving cave bears in this time period is '' far from convincing '' an unusual discovery in a deep chamber of basura cave in savona , italy , is thought to be related to cave bear worship , because there is a vaguely zoomorphic stalagmite surrounded by clay pellets compared with other megafaunal species that also became extinct during the last glacial maximum , the cave bear was believed to have had a more specialized diet of high-quality plants and a relatively restricted geographical range overhunting by humans has been largely dismissed because human populations at the time were too small to pose a serious threat to the cave bear 's survival , though the two species may have competed for living space in caves ice age cave bear found exquisitely preserved in siberian permafrost nearby , on the siberian mainland of yakutia , a tiny , beautifully preserved cave bear cub recently emerged from another patch of melting permafrost azykh cave bear cave darband cave dechen cave peștera cu oase divje babe flute
