working craft of this type include the later versions of the falmouth quay punt - and interest in this local type were taken by dixon kemp , an authority on yacht racing , in 1875 generally , a yawl is a double-ended , clinker built open boat , which can be worked under sail or oar they are considered to have viking or norse influence in their design a sixareen was typically 24 to 25 long overall these undecked sixareens operated between 30 and 50 miles offshore -sometimes within sight of norway until the 19th century , most of these boats were built in norway and then transported to shetland disassembled , where they were put back together again it appears that the norwegian boatbuilders built specific types of craft to meet the needs of the shetland market , as these boats differed somewhat from the ones used in norway norfolk and suffolk beach yawls whilst the earlier boats had three lug-rigged masts , in common with other types of british lugger , from the middle of the 19th century the mainmast was usually dispensed with to give a dipping lug foresail and a standing lug mizzen a lookout tower was manned to spot any ship signalling for a pilot or in distress there was competition between each company to get any potential work if worked under oar , a yawl would have 10 or more oars a side - though the beach companies usually operated a gig in light weather if delivering or collecting a pilot , as they were faster under oars when navy dockyards started to copy the deal-built boats , they moved to carvel construction the number of oars depended on the size of the boat , 8 and 6 being common , with some rowed by just 4 oars ,
