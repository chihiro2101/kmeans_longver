as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology other key theorists include gustave le bon ( 1841–1931 ) who believed that crowds possessed a 'racial unconscious ' with primitive , aggressive , and antisocial instincts , and william mcdougall ( psychologist ) , who believed in a 'group mind , ' which had a distinct existence born from the interaction of individuals throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues in group psychology and the analysis of the ego , ( 1922 ) , sigmund freud based his preliminary description of group psychology on le bon 's work , but went on to develop his own , original theory , related to what he had begun to elaborate in totem and taboo '' hammer , espen adorno and the political , pp.58-9 william schutz ( 1958 , 1966 ) looked at interpersonal relations as stage-developmental , inclusion ( am i included ? ) , control ( who is top dog here ? ) , and affection ( do i belong here ? ) ( updated version based on 1958 work ) palo alto , ca : science and behavior books page 194 to 196 , irvin d the tavistock institute has further developed and applied the theory and practices developed by bion tuckman 's model states that the ideal group decision-making process should occur in four stages : forming ( pretending to get on or get along with others ) storming ( letting down the politeness barrier and trying to get down to the issues even if tempers flare up ) norming ( getting used to each other and developing trust and productivity ) performing ( working in a group to a common goal on a highly efficient and cooperative basis ) tuckman later added a fifth stage for the dissolution of a group called adjourning ( adjourning may also be referred to as mourning , i.e mourning the adjournment of the group ) this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways scott peck developed stages for larger-scale groups ( i.e leading teams : setting the stage for great performances compelling direction : which results from a clear , challenging , and consequential goal enabling structure : which results from having tasks which have variety , a group size that is not too large , talented group members who have at least moderate social skill , and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour supportive context : which occurs in groups nested in larger groups ( e.g intragroup dynamics ( also referred to as ingroup- , within-group , or commonly just ‘ group dynamics ’ ) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms , roles , relations , and common goals that characterize a particular social group in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s the psychology of social norms if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available examples of groups to be sorted were a sports team , a family , people at a bus stop and women it was found that participants consistently sorted groups into four categories : intimacy groups , task groups , loose associations , and social categories cooley believed that primary groups were essential for integrating individuals into their society since this is often their first experience with a group examples of collectives include a flash mob , an audience at a movie , and a crowd watching a building burn an individual 's identity ( or self-concept ) has two components : personal identity and social identity ( or collective self ) optimal distinctiveness theory suggests that individuals have a desire to be similar to others , but also a desire to differentiate themselves , ultimately seeking some balance of these two desires ( to obtain optimal distinctiveness ) in the social sciences , group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected since then , several models for understanding the concept of group cohesion have been developed , including albert carron 's hierarchical model and several bi-dimensional models ( vertical v horizontal cohesion , task v social cohesion , belongingness and morale , and personal v this is called the black sheep effect the way a person judges socially desirable and socially undesirable individuals depends upon whether they are part of the ingroup or outgroup whereas new members of a group must prove themselves to the full members to become accepted , full members have undergone socialization and are already accepted within the group nevertheless , depending on the self-esteem of an individual , members of the in-group may experience different private beliefs about the group 's activities but will publicly express the opposite—that they actually share these beliefs if the person is privately self-aware , he or she is more likely to comply with the group even if they possibly have their own beliefs about the situation these include decisions related to ingroup bias , persuasion ( see asch conformity experiments ) , obedience ( see milgram experiment ) , and groupthink group structure has also been defined as the underlying pattern of roles , norms , and networks of relations among members that define and organize the group new york : wadsworth a group with a high level of role differentiation would be categorized as having many different roles that are specialized and narrowly defined journal of occupational and organizational psychology norms are the informal rules that groups adopt to regulate members ' behaviour examining the intermember relations of a group can highlight a group 's density ( how many members are linked to one another ) , or the degree centrality of members ( number of ties between members ) with a centralized pattern , communications tend to flow from one source to all group members when decentralized , communications tend to flow more freely , but the delivery of information may not be as fast or accurate as with centralized communications age , race , ethnicity ) status differentials may affect the relative amount of pay among group members and they may also affect the group 's tolerance to violation of group norms ( e.g in the first—audience effects—zajonc observed behaviour in the presence of passive spectators , and the second—co-action effects—he examined behaviour in the presence of another individual engaged in the same activity in his theory of social facilitation , zajonc concluded that in the presence of others , when action is required , depending on the task requirement , either social facilitation or social interference will impact the outcome of the task zajonc hypothesized that compresence ( the state of responding in the presence of others ) elevates an individual 's drive level which in turn triggers social facilitation when tasks are simple and easy to execute , but impedes performance when tasks are challenging it predicts that self-confident individuals with a positive outlook will show performance gains through social facilitation , whereas a self-conscious individual approaching social situations with apprehension is less likely to perform well due to social interference effects intergroup dynamics ( or intergroup relations ) refers to the behavioural and psychological relationship between two or more groups this comparison process is not unbiased and objective intergroup conflict is commonly recognized amidst racial , ethnic , religious , and political groups these include the contact hypothesis , the jigsaw classroom , and several categorization-based strategies contact hypothesis ( intergroup contact theory ) models utilizing superordinate identities include the common ingroup identity model , the ingroup projection model , the mutual intergroup differentiation model , and the ingroup identity model in the robbers cave experiment , sherif used this strategy to reduce conflict between groups in 1971 , thick racial tensions were abounding in austin , texas board of education in 1954 )
