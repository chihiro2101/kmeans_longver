rather than differentiating network traffic based on the requirements of an individual flow , diffserv operates on the principle of traffic classification , placing each data packet into one of a limited number of traffic classes each router on the network is then configured to differentiate traffic based on its class for tight control over volumes and type of traffic in a given class , a network operator may choose not to honor markings at the ingress to the diffserv domain traffic in each class may be further conditioned by subjecting the traffic to rate limiting , traffic policers or shapers in practice , however , most networks use the following commonly defined per-hop behaviors : default forwarding ( df ) phb — which is typically best-effort traffic expedited forwarding ( ef ) phb — dedicated to low-loss , low-latency traffic assured forwarding ( af ) phb — gives assurance of delivery under prescribed conditions class selector phbs — which maintain backward compatibility with the ip precedence field the ef phb has the characteristics of low delay , low loss and low jitter the recommended dscp for ef is 101110 b ( 46 or 2e h ) the ietf defines the assured forwarding ( af ) behavior in and it is up to all the service providers and their routers in the path to ensure that their policies will take care of the packets in an appropriate fashion in order to achieve an end-to-end allocation of resources across separate domains , the bandwidth broker managing a domain will have to communicate with its adjacent peers , which allows end-to-end services to be constructed out of purely bilateral agreements — definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers — assured forwarding phb group — definition of differentiated services per-domain behaviors and rules for their specification ) — supplemental information for the new definition of the ef phb ( expedited forwarding per-hop behavior ) ( updates and , obsoletes ietf diffserv working group page cisco whitepaper — diffserv-the scalable end-to-end quality of service model acm sigcomm'09 paper- modeling and understanding end-to-end class of service policies in operational networks : proposes a practical model for extracting diffserv policies cisco : implementing quality of service policies with dscp
