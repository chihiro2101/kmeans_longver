as a physical concept this requirement has been very influential in the past , in the first place as a result of direct observation of causal processes ( like pushing a cart ) , in the second place as a problematic aspect of newton 's theory of gravitation ( attraction of the earth by the sun by means of action at a distance ) replacing mechanistic proposals like descartes ' vortex theory ; in the third place as an incentive to develop dynamic field theories ( e.g in modern physics , the notion of causality had to be clarified einstein , '' zur elektrodynamik bewegter koerper '' , annalen der physik 17 , 891–921 ( 1905 ) however , the principle of locality is disputed : whether it strictly holds depends on the interpretation of quantum mechanics chosen , especially for experiments involving quantum entanglement that satisfy bell 's theorem the ordinary situations in which humans singled out some factors in a physical interaction as being prior and therefore supplying the '' because '' of the interaction were often ones in which humans decided to bring about some state of affairs and directed their energies to producing that state of affairs—a process that took time to establish and left a new state of affairs that persisted beyond the time of activity of the actor ) such 'explanation by determinism ' is sometimes referred to as causal determinism if the wave function is presumed not to actually collapse as in the many-worlds interpretation , or if its collapse is due to hidden variables , or simply redefining determinism as meaning that probabilities rather than specific effects are determined ) a related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a causality as represented by inus for instance , when a massive sphere is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium , then its velocity is assumed to be caused by the force of gravity accelerating it ; the small push that was needed to set it into motion is not explicitly dealt with as a cause this means that it does not assume any pre-existing arena ( dimensional space ) , but rather attempts to show how the spacetime fabric itself evolves using a structure called a simplex , it divides spacetime into tiny triangular sections in other words , the timelines of all joined edges of simplices must agree this theorem states that the causal structure of a spacetime suffices to reconstruct its conformal class london : taylor and francis miguel espinoza , théorie du déterminisme causal , l ’ harmattan , paris , 2006
