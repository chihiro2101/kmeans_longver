each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) profiling is a complex process involving mathematics , intense computation , judgment , testing , and iteration for instance , pixels with equal values of r , g , b should appear neutral this calculation is required whenever data is exchanged inside a color-managed chain and carried out by a color matching module they therefore need some rearrangement near the borders of the gamut if an entire image is in-gamut , relative is perfect , but when there are out of gamut colors , which is preferable depends on a case-by-case basis color matching module ( also -method or -system ) is a software algorithm that adjusts the numerical values that get sent to or received from different devices so that the perceived color they produce remains consistent upton , steve ( february 2008 ) wcs supplements the image color management ( icm ) system in windows 2000 and windows xp , originally written by heidelberg the profile information tab should contain the entry '' linocolorcmm Â© by heidelberger druckmaschinen ag '' operating systems that use the x window system for graphics can use icc profiles , and support for linux color management , still less mature than on other platforms , is coordinated through openicc at freedesktop.org and makes use of littlecms some image software ( such as photoshop ) perform automatic color separation to maintain color information in cmyk mode using a specified icc profile such as us web coated ( swop ) v2 , notable browser support for color management is : firefox : from version 3.5 enabled by default for icc v2 tagged images , version 8.0 has icc v4 profiles support , but it needs to be activated manually pale moon supported icc v2 from its first release , and v4 since pale moon 20.2 ( 2013 ) gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management
