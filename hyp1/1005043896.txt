edison incorporated various elements into his phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day first , the sound enters a cone-shaped component of the device , called the microphone diaphragm this causes the needle to vibrate , and then the diaphragm another problem with the phonograph was the permanence of its recordings they could also not be reproduced economically , which was another reason why they were not seen as a viable option for recorded music what he came up with was not a cylinder at all , but was rather a flat circular disc much like modern vinyl records telegraphone - the wire recorder this machine was vastly different from the gramophone or the phonograph , in that instead of recording sound mechanically , it recorded using a process called magnetic storage like the recording devices that came before it , the telegraphone recordings were nearly impossible to edit rather than using heavy , expensive , and dangerous steel wire like poulsen , pfleumer realized that he could coat normal strips of paper with tiny particles of iron an inscriber , called the recording head , passes over the electromagnetic paper strip , creating patterns of varying magnetic polarity within it , which can later be played back these changes were translated into an electric current , which when amplified produced a replica of the previously recorded sounds the original magnetophon had its share of setbacks as well the introduction of tape bias to recording systems improved fidelity to acceptable and eventually high-fidelity performance
