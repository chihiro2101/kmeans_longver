four polymorphs are recognized all forms of al ( oh ) 3 crystals are hexagonal : gibbsite is also known as γ-al ( oh ) 3 or α-al ( oh ) 3 bayerite is also known as α-al ( oh ) 3 or β-alumina trihydrate citation needed nordstrandite is also known as al ( oh ) 3 doyleite hydrargillite , once thought to be aluminium hydroxide , is an aluminium phosphate it was historically stored in lagoons ; this led to the ajka alumina plant accident in 2010 in hungary , where a dam bursting led to the drowning of nine people . precursor to al compounds aluminium hydroxide is a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds : speciality calcined aluminas , aluminium sulfate , polyaluminium chloride , aluminium chloride , zeolites , sodium aluminate , activated alumina , and aluminium nitrate freshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide forms gels , which are the basis for the application of aluminium salts as flocculants in water purification such products can cause constipation , because the aluminium ions inhibit the contractions of smooth muscle cells in the gastrointestinal tract , slowing peristalsis and lengthening the time needed for stool to pass through the colon normally , the kidneys filter excess phosphate out from the blood , but kidney failure can cause phosphate to accumulate it appears to contribute to induction of a good th2 response , so is useful for immunizing against pathogens that are blocked by antibodies since then , multiple epidemiology studies have found no connection between exposure to environmental or swallowed aluminium and neurological disorders , though injected aluminium was not looked at in these studies
