each pulse rotates the shaft through a fixed angle stepper motors effectively have multiple '' toothed '' electromagnets arranged as a stator around a central rotor , a gear-shaped piece of iron to make the motor shaft turn , first , one electromagnet is given power , which magnetically attracts the gear 's teeth when the gear 's teeth are aligned to the first electromagnet , they are slightly offset from the next electromagnet from there the process is repeated for example , if the stepper motor has two groups identified as a or b , and ten electromagnets in total , then the grouping pattern would be ababababab electromagnets within the same group are all energized together , a single transistor ) for each winding typically , given a phase , the center tap of each winding is made common : giving three leads per phase and six leads for a typical two phase motor bipolar motors have a single winding per phase the current in a winding needs to be reversed in order to reverse a magnetic pole , so the driving circuit must be more complicated , typically with an h-bridge arrangement ( however there are several off-the-shelf driver chips available to make this a simple affair ) bipolar with parallel windings this requires higher current but can perform better as the winding inductance is reduced the resistance r determines the maximum current according to ohm 's law i v/r a 10 & nbsp ; mh inductance with 2 ohms resistance will take 5 & nbsp ; ms to reach approx 2/3 of maximum torque or around 24 & nbsp ; ms to reach 99 % of max torque ) with an l/r drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding this will waste power in the resistors , and generate heat chopper drive circuits are most often used with two-winding bipolar motors , the two windings being driven independently to provide a specific motor torque cw or ccw 0 % results in full v/r current in one direction this requires additional electronics to sense winding currents , and control the switching , but it allows stepper motors to be driven with higher torque at higher speeds than l/r drives it also allows the controller to output predetermined current levels rather than fixed it has the same number of steps as the full-step drive , but the motor will have significantly less torque than rated it is rarely used this increases the angular resolution zaber.com , microstepping regardless of the waveform used , as the microsteps become smaller , motor operation becomes more smooth , thereby greatly reducing resonance in any parts the motor may be connected to , as well as the motor itself additionally , soft magnetic material with many teeth on the rotor and stator cheaply multiplies the number of poles ( reluctance motor ) modern steppers are of hybrid design , having both permanent magnets and soft iron cores it is important to make sure that the load on the motor is frictional rather than inertial as the friction reduces any unwanted oscillations when the motor moves a single step it overshoots the final resting point and oscillates round this point as it comes to rest stepper motors have a natural frequency of operation motor resonance frequency can be calculated from the formula : : f \frac : rotor inertia kg·m² the magnitude of the undesirable ringing is dependent on the back emf resulting from rotor velocity a stepper 's low-speed torque will vary directly with current , nema 17 has a diameter of 1.7 inches ) there are also useful summaries and further information on the reprap site commercially , stepper motors are used in floppy disk , image scanners , computer printers , plotters , slot machines , image scanners , compact disc drives , intelligent lighting , camera lenses , cnc machines , and 3d printers a stepper motor system consists of three basic elements , often combined with some type of user interface ( host computer , plc or dumb terminal ) : ; indexers : the indexer ( or controller ) is a microprocessor capable of generating step pulses and direction signals for the driver advantages low cost for control achieved high torque at startup and low speeds ruggedness simplicity of construction can operate in an open loop control system low maintenance less likely to stall or slip will work in any environment can be used in robotics in a wide scale excellent response to starting/stopping/reversing brushed dc electric motor brushless dc electric motor flange fractional horsepower motors servo motor solenoid three-phase ac synchronous motors uln2003a ( stepper motor ) driver ic jones , the university of iowa stepping 101 nema motor , reprapwiki stepping motor drive guide from dover motion ip65 stepper motors ip68 stepper motors flame proof motor
