in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g each layer of the abdominal wall is then closed in turn the wound is dressed these incisions are placed for appendectomy : mcburney 's incision , also known as grid iron incision lanz incision rutherford morison incision paramedian incision over the past decade , the outcomes of laparoscopic appendectomies have compared favorably to those for open appendectomies because of decreased pain , fewer postoperative complications , shorter hospitalization , earlier mobilization , earlier return to work , and better cosmesis ; however , despite these advantages , efforts are still being made to decrease abdominal incision and visible scars after laparoscopy and roberts et al if appendicitis develops in a pregnant woman , an appendectomy is usually performed and should not harm the fetus thumb thumb a study from 2010 found that the average hospital stay for people with appendicitis in the united states was 1.8 days for people with a perforated ( ruptured ) appendix , the average length of stay was 5.2 days agency for healthcare research and quality , rockville , md patients with complicated appendicitis ( perforated appendicitis ) are more likely to develop a ssi , abdominal abscess , or pelvic abscess during the post-operative period however , abdominal drains have not been found to play a significant role in reducing ssis and have lead to increased length of stay in the hospital in addition to increased cost of the operation about 327,000 appendectomies were performed during u.s hospital stays in 2011 , a rate of 10.5 procedures per 10,000 population appendectomies accounted for 2.1 % of all operating-room procedures in 2011 george 's hospital in london , when french surgeon claudius amyand described the presence of a perforated appendix within the inguinal hernial sac of an 11-year-old boy on september 13 , 1980 , kurt semm performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy opening up the path for a much wider application of minimally invasive surgery while appendectomy is a standard surgical procedure , its cost has been found to vary considerably in the united states
