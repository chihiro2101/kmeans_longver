in the second half of the 19th century , however , a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the maya by 1862 , about 1,000 maya established themselves in 10 villages in this area , with the center in san pedro early in 1867 , more than 300 british troops marched into the yalbac hills and destroyed the mayan villages , provision stores , and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district after several hours of fighting , canul 's group retired canul , mortally wounded , died on 1 september 1872 the mopán and kekchí maya maintained their languages and a strong sense of identity however , the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods exports of mahogany peaked at over 4 million linear metres in 1846 but fell to about 1.6 million linear meters in 1859 and 8,000 linear meters in 1870 , the lowest level since the beginning of the century . colonial order , 1871–1931 under the new constitution of 1871 , the lieutenant governor and the legislative council , consisting of five ex-officio or '' official '' and four appointed or '' unofficial '' members , governed british honduras by about 1890 , most commerce in british honduras was in the hands of a clique of scottish and german merchants , most of them newcomers the european minority exercised great influence in the colony 's politics , partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed legislative council exports of chicle , a gum taken from the sapodilla tree and used to make chewing gum , propped up the economy from the 1880s men such as robert s turton , the creole chicle buyer for wrigley 's , and henry i the great depression shattered the colony 's economy , and unemployment increased rapidly the total value of imports and exports in the latter year was little more than one-fourth of what it had been in 1929 in 1931 , when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression , family member oliver v.g when the government almost doubled the land tax , the large landowners refused to pay but brown 's defeat by turton , one of the company 's chief local business rivals , marked the decline of old british enterprises in relation to the rising creole entrepreneurs with their united states commercial connections meanwhile , the belize estate and produce company drove maya villagers from their homes in san jose and yalbac in the northwest and treated workers in mahogany camps almost like slaves investigators of labour conditions in the 1930s were appalled to discover that workers received rations of inferior flour and mess pork and tickets to be exchanged at the commissaries , in lieu of cash wages for the next few weeks , soberanis and his colleagues in the lua attacked the governor and his officials , the rich merchants , and the belize estate and produce company at biweekly meetings attended by 600 to 800 people workers built more than 300 kilometres of roads the citizens ' political party and the lua endorsed robert turton and arthur balderamos , a creole lawyer , who formed the chief opposition in the new council of 1936 employers among the unofficial members at the legislative council defeated a bill to repeal these penal clauses in august 1941 , but the employers and workers bill passed on 27 april 1943 , finally removed breach-of-labour-contract from the criminal code and enabled british honduras 's infant trade unions to pursue the struggle for improving labour conditions in 1945 only 822 voters were registered in a population of over 63,000 the proportion of voters increased slightly in 1945 , partly because the minimum age for women voters was reduced from thirty to twenty-one years finally , in 1954 british honduras achieved suffrage for all literate adults as a result of the emerging independence movement this development was a prelude to the process of constitutional decolonisation its leaders came from the lua and the local branch of marcus garvey 's universal negro improvement association the devaluation enraged labour because it protected the interests of the big transnationals , such as the belize estate and produce company , whose trade in british pounds would have suffered without devaluation while it subjected british honduras 's working class , already experiencing widespread unemployment and poverty , to higher prices for goods—especially food—imported from the united states the gwu was the only mass organisation of working people , so the early success of the independence movement would have been impossible without the support of this union belize billboard editors philip goldson and leigh richardson were prominent members of the pup and gave the party their full support through anti-colonial editorials the political leaders took control of the union to use its strength , and in turn the union movement declined as it became increasingly dependent upon politicians in the 1950s in short , pup pushed for representative and responsible government in july 1951 , the governor dissolved the belize city council on the pretext that it had shown disloyalty by refusing to display a picture of king george vi further constitutional reform was unequivocally on the agenda . decolonisation and the border dispute with guatemala british honduras faced two obstacles to independence : british reluctance until the early 1960s to allow citizens to govern themselves , and guatemala 's complete intransigence over its long-standing claim to the entire territory guatemala had an alternative view that this agreement stated that guatemala would give up its territorial claims only under certain conditions , including the construction of a road from guatemala to the caribbean coast talks resumed in 1973 , but broke off again in 1975 when tensions flared once more with the prospect of independence celebrations in the offing , the opposition 's morale fell and independence came to belize on 21 september 1981 , without an agreement with guatemala in 1853 the public meeting system was abandoned in favour of a legislative assembly , part of which was elected by a restricted franchise the confederate settlements in british honduras introduced large-scale sugar production to the colony and proved that it could be profitable where others had previously failed the lack of diversification in the economy left the colony very susceptible to swings in the mahogany market from 1914 on , the forestry industry was in steady decline , except for a brief revival during world war ii ( 1939–1945 ) the mayans are still present in belize and comprise around 11 % of the population the population of the colony was always fairly small in 1790 it was around 4,000 in 1856 it was estimated to be 20,000 by 1931 this figure grew to just over 50,000 , and in 1946 to just under 60,000 however , by 1970 the population doubled to just under 120,000
