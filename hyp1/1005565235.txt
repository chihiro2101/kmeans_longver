lanolin â€™ s complex composition of long-chain esters , hydroxyesters , diesters , lanolin alcohols , and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right , it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives , which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties notably , approximately 40 % of the acids derived from lanolin are alpha-hydroxy acids ( ahas ) a second monograph also introduced into the us pharmacopoeia xxii in 1992 was entitled 'modified lanolin ' in this monograph , the limit of total pesticides was reduced to 3 & nbsp ; ppm total pesticides , with no individual limit greater than 1 & nbsp ; ppm this requirement , which is generally regarded as the new quality standard , extends the list of pesticides to 40 and imposes even lower concentration limits some very high-purity grades of lanolin surpass monograph requirements polarized light microscopy has shown the lamellar vesicles formed by lanolin are identical to those formed by human stratum corneum lipids in a small clinical study conducted on volunteer subjects with terribly dry ( xerotic ) hands , lanolin was shown to be superior to petrolatum in reducing the signs and symptoms of dryness and scaling , cracks and abrasions , and pain and itch lanolin is also found in lubricants , rust-preventive coatings , shoe polish , and other commercial products however , allergy to a lanolin-containing product is difficult to pinpoint and often other products containing lanolin may be fine for use it is frequently used in protective baby skin treatment and for sore nipples in breastfeeding mothers baseball players often use it to soften and break in their baseball gloves ( shaving cream with lanolin is popularly used for this ) the wool grease is continuously removed during this washing process by centrifuge separators , which concentrate it into a waxlike substance melting at approximately
