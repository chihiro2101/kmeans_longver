alice was built and operated by the southwest research institute for nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory virtis ( visible and infrared thermal imaging spectrometer ) the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar this allowed it to determine the comet 's internal structure and deduce information on its composition rosina ( rosetta orbiter spectrometer for ion and neutral analysis ) the instrument consisted of a double-focus sector instrument ( dfms ) and a reflectron type time of flight ( rtof ) the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument cosima was built by the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics ( mpe , germany ) with international contributions rpc ( rosetta plasma consortium ) . search for organic compounds ; amino acids upon landing on the comet , philae should have also tested some hypotheses as to why essential amino acids are almost all '' left-handed '' , which refers to how the atoms arrange in orientation in relation to the carbon core of the molecule the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible preliminary analyses strongly suggest the carbon is present as polyaromatic organic solids mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel alloys measurements by the cosac and ptolemy instruments on the philae lander revealed sixteen organic compounds , four of which were seen for the first time on a comet , including acetamide , acetone , methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde . timeline of major events and discoveries ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth 4 july – imaging instruments on board observed the collision between the comet tempel 1 and the impactor of the deep impact mission ; 2008 5 september – flyby of asteroid 2867 šteins 12 november 2014 – philae lands on the surface of 67p 10 december 2014 – data from the rosina mass spectrometers show that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67p is more than three times that on earth 11 august 2015 – scientists release images of a comet outburst that occurred on 29 july 2015 as part of the european space agency 's media campaign in support of the rosetta mission , both the rosetta and philae spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled once upon a time the giotto spacecraft is also depicted as the duo 's grandfather , whereas others in the halley armada as well as nasa 's deep impact and stardust spacecraft are depicted as their cousins '' ryan wallace of ibt media also gave praise to the film , writing , '' whether you 're a sci-fi fanatic , or simply an interested humble astronomer , the short clip will undoubtedly give you a new view of our solar system , and the research out there in space today the hashtag '' cometlanding '' gained widespread traction , 1080p hd , english )
