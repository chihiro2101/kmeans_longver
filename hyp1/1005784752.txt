the only other flight to suffer a fatal accident , soyuz 11 , killed its crew of three when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry the soyuz is not reusable ; it is expendable it has an automatic docking system the vostok spacecraft utilized an ejector seat to bail out the cosmonaut in the event of a low-altitude launch failure , as well as during reentry , however it would probably have been ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy based on data from r-7 launches over the years , engineers developed a list of the most likely failure modes for the vehicle and could narrow down abort conditions to premature separation of a strap-on booster , low engine thrust , loss of combustion chamber pressure , or loss of booster guidance four folding stabilizers were added to improve aerodynamic stability during ascent the uncrewed progress resupply ferry has a dummy escape tower and removes the stabilizer fins from the payload shroud there have been three failed launches of a crewed soyuz vehicle , soyuz 18a in 1975 , soyuz t-10a in 1983 and soyuz ms-10 in october 2018 most recently in 2018 , the sas sub-system in the payload shroud of soyuz ms-10 successfully rescued the cosmonauts from a rocket failure 2 minutes and 45 second after liftoff after the escape tower had already been jettisoned internal volume is , living space this separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module the convention of orientation in a micro-g environment differs from that of the descent module , as crew members stand or sit with their heads to the docking port one of the design requirements for the descent module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency ( internal volume divided by hull area ) the best shape for this is a sphere – as the pioneering vostok spacecraft 's descent module used – but such a shape can provide no lift , which results in a purely atmospheric entry the failure of several explosive bolts did not cut the connection between the service and reentry modules on the latter two flights since the soyuz tm-5 landing issue , the orbital module is once again detached only after the reentry firing , which led to ( but did not cause ) emergency situations of soyuz tma-10 and tma-11 700px the soyuz spacecraft has been the subject of continuous evolution since the early 1960s thus several different versions , proposals and projects exist sergei korolev initially promoted the soyuz a-b-v circumlunar complex ( 7k-9k-11k ) concept ( also known as l1 ) in which a two-man craft soyuz 7k would rendezvous with other components ( 9k and 11k ) in earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle , the components being delivered by the proven r-7 rocket the probe and drogue docking system permitted internal transfer of cosmonauts from the soyuz to the station the remaining 7k-l1s were scrapped this was the first in-flight fatality in the history of spaceflight these versions were named soyuz p , soyuz ppk , soyuz r , soyuz 7k-vi , and soyuz ois ( orbital research station ) thumb the third generation soyuz-t ( t : spacecraft ( 1976 & ndash ; 1986 ) featured solar panels allowing longer missions , a revised igla rendezvous system and new translation/attitude thruster system on the service module thumb the soyuz-tm crew transports ( m : were fourth generation soyuz spacecraft , and were used from 1986 to 2003 for ferry flights to mir and the international space station ( iss ) the mission used a new six-hour rendezvous , faster than the previous soyuz launches , which had , since 1986 , taken two days
