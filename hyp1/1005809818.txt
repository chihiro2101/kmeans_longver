other names include tiling , mosaicing , pixelating , quilting , and checkerboarding the lower the bit rate , the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero this leads to discontinuities at the block boundaries as such it is not a '' post-processing '' technique motion compensation block boundary artifacts video compression artifacts include cumulative results of compression of the comprising still images , for instance ringing or other edge busyness in successive still images appear in sequence as a shimmering blur of dots around edges , called mosquito noise , as they resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object p.930 ( 08/96 ) principles of a reference impairment system for video the so-called '' mosquito noise '' is caused by the block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) compression algorithm used in most video coding standards , such as the mpeg formats to that end , the encoder conceptually integrates a decoder if this '' decoder '' performs a deblocking , the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation , which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames with low compression , a conservative psy-model is used with small block sizes in general , musical tones have repeating waveforms and more predictable variations in volume , whereas applause is essentially random , therefore hard to compress jpegs , thomas ruff , aperture , may 31 , 2009 , 132 pp davis in collaboration with paperrad , and more recently used by david oreilly and within music videos for chairlift and by nabil elderkin in the '' welcome to heartbreak '' music video for kanye west
