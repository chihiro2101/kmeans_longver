examples of mitochondrial diseases include : mitochondrial myopathy diabetes mellitus and deafness ( dad ) this combination at an early age can be due to mitochondrial disease diabetes mellitus and deafness can be found together for other reasons leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy ( lhon ) visual loss beginning in young adulthood eye disorder characterized by progressive loss of central vision due to degeneration of the optic nerves and retina affects 1 in 50,000 people in finland leigh syndrome , subacute sclerosing encephalopathy after normal development the disease usually begins late in the first year of life , although onset may occur in adulthood a rapid decline in function occurs and is marked by seizures , altered states of consciousness , dementia , ventilatory failure neuropathy , ataxia , and retinitis pigmentosa ( narp ) progressive symptoms as described in the acronym dementia myoneurogenic gastrointestinal encephalopathy ( mngie ) gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction neuropathy merrf syndrome progressive myoclonic epilepsy '' ragged red fibers '' are clumps of diseased mitochondria that accumulate in the subsarcolemmal region of the muscle fiber and appear when muscle is stained with modified gömöri trichrome stain short stature hearing loss lactic acidosis exercise intolerance melas syndrome mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome conditions such as friedreich 's ataxia can affect the mitochondria but are not associated with mitochondrial proteins if only a few of the mtdna copies inherited from the mother are defective , mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria ( for more detailed inheritance patterns , see human mitochondrial genetics ) mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level ; this phenomenon is called '' threshold expression '' defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial dna replication ( all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear dna ) may also cause mitochondrial dna mutations other studies have shown that the mechanism may involve the interruption of the mitochondrial signaling process in body cells ( intramyocellular lipids ) the procedure could be offered from 29 october 2015 once regulations had been established the human fertilisation and embryology ( mitochondrial donation ) regulations 2015 no 572 knapton , sarah ( 1 march 2014 ) 'three-parent babies ' could be born in britain next year the daily telegraph science news , retrieved 1 march 2014 embryonic mitochondrial transplant and protofection have been proposed as a possible treatment for inherited mitochondrial disease , and allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins as a radical treatment for mtdna mutation load in all states , legislation prohibited the use of mrt techniques in the clinic , and except for western australia , research on a limited range of mrt was permissible up to day 14 of embryo development , subject to a license being granted in 2010 , the hon up to 4,000 children per year in the us are born with a type of mitochondrial disease index page with links to summaries including one page summary flyer international mito patients ( imp )
