a pound lock is a type of lock that is used almost exclusively nowadays on canals and rivers they replaced earlier double slipways that had caused trouble and are mentioned by the chinese polymath shen kuo ( 1031–1095 ) in his book dream pool essays ( published in 1088 ) , needham , volume 4 , part 3 , 351–52 the gates were 'hanging gates ' ; when they were closed the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached , and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out the italy bertola da novate ( c needham , volume 4 , part 3 , 358 when a stretch of river is made navigable , a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid , dam , or mill weir – because of the change in river level across the obstacle a weir will increase the depth of a shallow stretch , and the required lock will either be built in a gap in the weir , or at the downstream end of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir and perhaps a shallow stretch of river below it a river improved by these means is often called a waterway or river navigation ( see example calder and hebble navigation ) as engineers became more ambitious in the types of country they felt they could overcome , locks became essential to effect the necessary changes in water level without detours that would be completely uneconomic both in building costs and journey time basic construction and operation due to the use of 10 water saving basins , only 10,500 m 3 of water are used a more recent example is the rhine–main–danube canal with 13 saving locks out of a total of 16 locks there are no working waterway inclined planes in the uk at the moment , but the remains of a famous one can be seen at foxton in leicestershire on the leicester arm of the grand union canal as the boat is not floating , archimedes ' principle does not apply , so the weight lifted or lowered by the device varies – making counterbalancing ( by dead weights or a second boat carriage ) more difficult it was the winning design in a competition to design a new lock each lift has a capacity of 1,300 tonnes the vertical distance lifted is in this underwater lift , the chamber was 80 & nbsp ; ft long and deep and contained a completely enclosed wooden box big enough to take a barge possibly inspired by weldon 's caisson lock , william congreve in 1813 patented a '' hydro-pneumatic double balance lock '' in which two adjacent locks containing pneumatic caissons could be raised and lowered in counterbalance by the movement of compressed air from one caisson to the other the fall would have been , astonishing in 1749 hadfield ( 1986 ) p the '' diagonal lock advisory group '' has identified several sites in britain where the new design could be installed , either on new waterways or canals under restoration
