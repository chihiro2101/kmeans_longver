this period contains technetium , one of the two elements until lead that has no stable isotopes ( along with promethium ) , as well as molybdenum and iodine , two of the heaviest elements with a known biological role , and niobium has the largest magnetic known penetration depth of all the elements : ( ) exception to the madelung rule it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements rubidium is very susceptible to redox in air , similar to most of the other alkali metals , so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide , a yellow solid with the chemical formula rb 2 o if it does come in contact with water , though , it will combine with the atoms of both oxygen and hydrogen to form strontium hydroxide and pure hydrogen gas which quickly diffuses in the air when ignited , it will burn with a strong red flame its only stable isotope , 89 y , is also its only naturally occurring isotope other uses include the production of electrodes , electrolytes , electronic filters , lasers and superconductors ; various medical applications ; and as traces in various materials to enhance their properties yttrium has no known biological role , and exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 the name of zirconium is taken from the mineral zircon its atomic mass is 91.224 the english chemistcharles hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 , and named it columbium although alloys contain only a maximum of 0.1 % , that small percentage of niobium improves the strength of the steel the free element , which is a silvery metal , has the sixth-highest melting point of any element most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water , but the molybdate ion moo 4 2− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound rhodium is a so-called noble metal , resistant to corrosion , found in platinum- or nickel ores together with the other members of the platinum group metals white gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its optical impression while sterling silver is often rhodium plated for tarnish resistance he named it after the 2 pallas , which was itself named after the epithet of the greek goddess athena , acquired by her when she slew pallas ore deposits of palladium and other pgms are rare , and the most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the bushveld igneous complex covering the transvaal basin in south africa , the stillwater complex in montana , united states , the thunder bay district of ontario , canada , and the norilsk in russia recycling is also a source of palladium , mostly from scrapped catalytic converters while many medical antimicrobial uses of silver have been supplanted by antibiotics , further research into clinical potential continues cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol cd and atomic number 48 cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and therefore is a byproduct of zinc production indium was discovered in 1863 and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum that was the first indication of its existence in zinc ores , as a new and unknown element the metal was first isolated in the following year it is also used for making particularly low melting point alloys , and is a component in some lead-free solders it is a main group metal in group 14 of the periodic table tin is the 49th most abundant element and has , with 10 stable isotopes , the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table the largest application for metallic antimony is as alloying material for lead and tin tellurium was discovered in transylvania ( today part of romania ) in 1782 by franz-joseph müller von reichenstein in a mineral containing tellurium and gold martin heinrich klaproth named the new element in 1798 after the latin word for '' earth '' , tellus online etymology dictionary , s.v although generally unreactive , xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate , the first noble gas compound to be synthesized —national standard reference data service of the ussr radioactive xenon-135 is produced from iodine-135 as a result of nuclear fission , and it acts as the most significant neutron absorber in nuclear reactors the first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule ( xe 2 ) as its lasing medium , and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps rubidium , strontium , yttrium , zirconium , and niobium have no biological role technetium , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , silver , tin , and antimony have no biological role iodine is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions ( only tungsten , employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria , is heavier )
