there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions amino acids at the binding site of ubiquitin generally follow the induced fit model , whereas the rest of the protein generally adheres to conformational selection this concept was suggested by the 19th-century chemist emil fischer he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency the lock and key hypothesis can not explain this , as it would predict a high efficiency of methylglucoside glycosyl transfer due to its tight binding . types of non-covalent interactions for example , when a carboxylic acid ( r-cooh ) dissociates into rcoo − and h + ions , coo − will attract positively charged groups such as protonated guanidine side chain of arginine approximation of the reactant during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity this approach has various purposes in addition , this binding is favoured by entropy as the energy cost associated with solution reaction is largely eliminated since solvent can not enter active site in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy amino acids that can form nucleophile including serine , cysteine , aspartate and glutamine metal ions have multiple roles during the reaction this is called general acid and general base theory these acids and bases can stabilise the nucleophile or electrophile formed during the catalysis by providing positive and negative charges quantitative studies of enzymatic reactions often found that the acceleration of chemical reaction speed can not be fully explained by existing theories like the approximation , acid/base catalysis and electrophile/nucleophile catalysis so the active site can substitute solvent molecules and surround the substrates to minimize the counterproductive effect imposed by the solution . examples of enzyme catalysis mechanisms glutathione reductase is a dimer that contains two identical subunits the catalytic process starts when the fad is reduced by nadph to accept one electron and from fadh − in chymotrypsin , these residues are ser-195 , his-57 and asp-102 the nucleophilicity of ser-195 is enhanced by his-57 , which abstracts a proton from ser-195 and is in turn stabilised by the negatively charged carboxylate group ( rcoo − ) in asp-102 the resulting hydroxide anion nucleophilically attacks the acyl-enzyme complex to form a second tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate , which is once again stabilised by h bonds coenzymes are referred to those non-protein molecules that bind with enzymes to help them fulfill their jobs for example , the heme in cytochrome c is bound to the protein through thioester it can act as an electron acceptor in reaction , like the oxidation of nad to nadh , to accept two electrons and form 1,5-dihydroflavin on the other hand , it can form semiquinone ( free radical ) by accepting one electron , and then converts to fully reduced form by the addition of an extra electron there are different types of inhibitor , including both reversible and irreversible forms competitive inhibition are inhibitors that only target free enzyme molecules they have two mechanisms they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme allosteric interactions are often present in metabolic pathways and are beneficial in that they allow one step of a reaction to regulate another step alan fersht , structure and mechanism in protein science : a guide to enzyme catalysis and protein folding ( 2nd edition ) , blackwell publishing limited , 2004 .
