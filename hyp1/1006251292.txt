the children reported their size judgements in turn , and the child being tested was asked last however , when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher the children proved much more resistant to their peers ' pressure , illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions a study conducted in a remedial kindergarten class in the edna a hill child development laboratory in the university of kansas designed a program to measure how children could ease disruptive behavior in their peers through a two-part system manstead and miles hewstone ( eds ) , the blackwell encyclopedia of social psychology , 1996 peer pressure is commonly associated with episodes of adolescent risk taking because these activities commonly occur in the company of peers additionally , girls and boys reported facing differing amounts of pressures in different areas of their lives , perhaps reflecting a different set of values and priorities for each gender this has been shown for a variety of substances , including nicotine and alcohol for example , parental monitoring is negatively associated with substance use ; yet when there is little monitoring , adolescents are more likely to succumb to peer coercion during initiation to substance use , but not during the transition from experimental to regular use allen and colleagues showed that susceptibility to peer pressure in 13- and 14-year-olds was predictive of not only future response to peer pressure , but also a wider array of functioning this would be because you have shifted from being influenced by your parents to being influenced by your college peers . peer pressure and sexual intercourse there is evidence supporting the conclusion that parental attitudes disapproving sex tends to lead toward lower levels of adolescent unplanned pregnancy a study completed in cape town , south africa , looked at students at four secondary schools in the region literature reviews in this field have attempted to analyze the norms present in the interactions and decision making behind these behaviors a review conducted by bongardt et al defined three types of peer norms that led to a person 's participation in sexual intercourse : descriptive norms , injunctive norms , and outright peer pressure between the two indirect norms , descriptive norms had a stronger effect : people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group the more trouble a subject had with self-regulation and self-control growing up , the more they were likely to fall prey to peer pressure that would lead them to engage in risky sexual acts found that determining an object 's social value/significance is dependent on combined information from the mpfc and the striatum along the lines denoted in the beginning of the paragraph a similar experiment was conducted by stallen , smidts , and sanfrey the experiment confirmed the importance of the striatum in social influence , suggesting that conformity with the in-group is mediated with a fundamental value signal—rewards to rid oneself of this internal conflict ( self-rejection ) , an “ identity shift ” is undertaken , where one adopts the group ’ s standards as one ’ s own , thereby eliminating internal conflict ( in addition to the formerly eliminated external conflict ) , returning one to a state of harmony research suggests there are a variety of benefits from social media use , such as increased socialization , exposure to ideas , and greater self-confidence the way others portray themselves on social media might lead to young people trying to mimic those qualities or actions in an attempt at conformity over 3 billion social media users across the world are using a variety of platforms , in turn , the type , frequency , and scope of the resulting peer pressure fluctuates as such , there are two positions , most notably held by christopher browning and david goldhagen they were drafted but found ineligible for regular military duty the battalion was ordered to round up the men in the ghetto and kill all women , children , and elderly on sight at the end of his book , browning supplies his theory on 101 's actions : a combination of authoritative and peer pressure was a powerful coercive tool furthermore , according to browning 's analysis , one reason so few men separated themselves from their task was peer pressure—individual policemen did not want to '' lose face '' in front of their comrades . goldhagen 's hitler 's willing executioners its release was highly controversial furthermore , konrad kwiet , a holocaust historian , argues that goldhagen 's narrow focus on german anti-semitism has blinded him to other considerations he points to the massacres of non-jews as an example : '' goldhagen does not shine light on the motives of “ hitler ’ s willing executioners ” in murdering handicapped people within the so-called “ euthanasia program ” , in liquidating 2.7 million soviet prisoners of war , in exterminating romas or in killing hundreds of thousands of other people classified as enemies of the “ german people and nation ” the primary belligerents were the hutu ; however , as with most ethnic conflict conflicts , not all hutu wanted to kill tutsi for example , starting at a set point such as the home of a '' mobilizing '' agent for the hutu ( any individual who planned or led an attack in the village ) , the proportion of convicts living in a 100m radius of a resident is almost twice as many for convicts ( individuals convicted of genocide by the gacaca , a local institution of transitional justice that allows villagers to adjudicate on many of the perpetrators ’ crimes by themselves ) as for non-convicts as the radius increases , so does the proportion decrease of course , the complete situation is a little more nuanced these factors helped to drive the killing 's fast pace as a result , when the war came , the hutu were already introduced to the concept of racism against their very own peers king kigeli iv , a tutsi , centralized rwandan power in the 1800s , just in time for belgian colonization gerber , green , and larimer conducted a large-scale field experiment involving over 180,000 michigan households in 2006 and four treatments : one was a reminder to vote , one was a reminder to vote and a note informing them that they were being studied , one that listed the voting records for all potential household individuals , and finally one that listed the voting records for the household individuals and their neighbors the final treatment emphasized peer pressure within a neighborhood ; neighbors could view each other 's voting habits with the lists , and so the social norm of '' voting is best for the community '' is combined with the fear that individuals ' peers would judge their lack of voting the group was split into individual donators and pair donators furthermore , in pairs where one subject donated significantly more than the other , the latter would on average increase the donation amount by 0.55 pounds
