on the other hand , in extracellular space , the concentration of k⁺ is 5mm , whereas the concentration of na⁺ is 150mm another important task of the na⁺-k⁺ pump is to provide a na⁺ gradient that is used by certain carrier processes in the gut , for example , sodium is transported out of the reabsorbing cell on the blood ( interstitial fluid ) side via the na⁺-k⁺ pump , whereas , on the reabsorbing ( lumenal ) side , the na⁺-glucose symporter uses the created na⁺ gradient as a source of energy to import both na⁺ and glucose , which is far more efficient than simple diffusion . functioning as signal transducer for example in ramnanan cj 2006 , the study investigates the function of na+/k+atpase in foot muscle and hepatopancreas in land snail o.lactea comparing the active and estivating states they concluded that reversible phosphorylation can control the same means of coordinating atp use by this ion pump with the rates of the atp generation by catabolic pathways in estivating o lactea.the downstream signals through ouabain-triggered protein phosphorylation events include activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signal cascades , mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production , as well as activation of phospholipase c ( plc ) and inositol triphosphate ( ip3 ) receptor ( ip3r ) in different intracellular compartments the pump has a higher affinity for na⁺ ions than k⁺ ions , thus after binding atp , binds 3 intracellular na⁺ ions in contrast , substances causing a decrease in camp downregulate the na⁺/k⁺-atpase these include the ligands of the g i -coupled gpcrs its expression can also be modified through hormones such as triiodothyronine , a thyroid hormone for instance , na⁺/k⁺-atpase found in the membrane of heart cells is an important target of cardiac glycosides ( for example digoxin and ouabain ) , inotrope drugs used to improve heart performance by increasing its force of contraction it is via the inhibiting of the na+/k+-atpase that sodium levels will begin to increase within the cell which ultimately increases the concentration of intracellular calcium via the sodium-calcium exchanger na⁺/k⁺-atpase was discovered by jens christian skou in 1957 while working as assistant professor at the department of physiology , university of aarhus , denmark he published his work that year alpha : atp1a1 , atp1a2 , atp1a3 , atp1a4
