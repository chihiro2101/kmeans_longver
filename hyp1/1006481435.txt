the company was founded in hudson , massachusetts in 1968 many pdp-8s still operated decades later in these roles digital computer controls , inc during this period the nova generated 20 % annual growth rates for the company , becoming a star in the business community and generating us 100 million in sales in 1975 thacker and others at xerox parc during their construction of the xerox alto . late 1970s to late 1980s : crisis and a short term solution strong demand continued for the nova series , resulting in the nova 4 , perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the eclipse while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' references to '' the eagle project '' and '' project eagle '' co-exist ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 down to individual ranger stations and fire command posts despite some tensions , the implementation was effective and the overall effects on the agency notably positive the mv series came in various iterations , from the mv/2000 ( later mv/2500 ) , mv/4000 , mv/10000 , mv/15000 , mv/20000 , mv/30000 , mv/40000 and ultimately concluded with the mv/60000ha minicomputer at a time when dg invested its last dollar into the dying minicomputer segment , the microcomputer was rapidly making inroads to the lower-end market segment , and the introduction of the first workstations wiped out all 16-bit machines , once dg 's best customer segment related system software also in common use at the time included such packages as x.25 , xodiac , and tcp/ip for networking , fortran , cobol , rpg , pl/i , c and data general business basic for programming , infos ii and dg/dbms for databases , and the nascent relational database software dg/sql pln smacked of a micro-subset of pl/i , in sharp contrast to other languages of the time , such as bliss the dg easy product , a portable application platform developed by nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed , had roots easily traceable back to the rpg vm created by stephen schleimer in june 1987 , data general announced its intention to replace xodiac with the osi protocols data general produced a full range of peripherals , sometimes by rebadging printers for example , but data general 's own series of crt-based and hard-copy terminals were high quality and featured a generous number of function keys , each with the ability to send different codes , with any combination of control and shift keys , which influenced wordperfect design most data general software was written specifically for their own terminals ( or the terminal emulation built into the desktop generation dg10 , but the data general one built-in terminal emulator is not often suitable ) , although software using data general business basic could be more flexible in terminal handling , because logging into a business basic system would initiate a process whereby the terminal type would ( usually ) be auto-detected lock-in or no lock-in ? throughout the 1980s , the computer market had evolved dramatically in this market , the question of which machine was the '' best '' changed ; it was no longer the machine with the best priceâ€“performance ratio or service contracts , but the one that ran all of the third-party software the customer intended to use formerly , almost all computer companies attempted to make their machines different enough that when their customers sought a more powerful machine , it was often cheaper to buy another from the same company this was known as '' vendor lock-in '' , which helped guarantee future sales , even though the customers detested it in 1988 , two company directors put together a report showing that if the company were to continue existing in the future , dg would have to either invest heavily in software to compete with new applications being delivered by ibm and dec on their machines , or alternately exit the proprietary hardware business entirely they also outlined a different solution : instead of trying to compete against the much larger ibm and dec , they suggested that since the user no longer cared about the hardware as much as software , dg could deliver the best '' commodity '' machines instead on december 12 , 1989 , dg and soviet union software developer npo parma announced perekat , the first joint venture between an american computer company and a soviet company by this time a number of other vendors , notably sequent computer systems , were also introducing similar machines data general also targeted the explosion of the internet in the latter 1990s with the formation of the thiin line business unit , led by tom west , which had a focus on creation and sale of so-called '' internet appliances '' the acquisition was completed on october 12 , 1999 he authored djgpp , and currently works for red hat on gcc mike nash worked on aos/vs kernel virtual terminal services for pci and was a corporate vice president at microsoft and is currently vice president , consumer pc & solutions , printing and personal systems group , hewlett-packard company groove networks was acquired by microsoft in 2005 , and ozzie replaced bill gates as chief software architect at microsoft from 2006 until 2010 jit saxena founded netezza , search technology company christopher stone founded object management group ( created corba ) and became vice chairman/ceo of novell steve wallach cofounded convex computer tom west was the manager for the mv/8000 and later projects he was the main protagonist of the pulitzer prize winning non-fiction book the soul of a new machine little , brown and company reprint edition july 1997 by modern library
