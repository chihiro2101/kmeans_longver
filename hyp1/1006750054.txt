however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals on november 23 , 1897 , abram w , united states patent office , letters patent no duck , abram w in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s in the developing world , they were manufactured until much more recently used in combination with a rear coaster brake , a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake whitt , frank r and wilson , david g , bicycling science ( 2nd ed ) , massachusetts institute of technology , ( 1982 ) , , pp parliamentary debates : senate and house of representatives , tariff preferences , volume 34 ( 19 september 1906 ) , p 4951 in 1902 , louis h 708,114 , september 2 , 1902 duck brake company , testimonial of geo wyman ( 1903 ) : george a brake pads wear down and have to be replaced wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake in general , a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads , as long as the mounting is compatible ceramic-coated rims should be used with special pads because of heat build-up at the pad-rim interface ; standard pads can leave a '' glaze '' on the ceramic braking surface , reducing its inherent roughness and leading to a severe drop in wet-weather braking performance ceramic pads usually contain chromium compounds to resist heat these salmon-colored pads were first made by scott-mathauser and are now produced by kool-stop to minimise excessive rim wear , a brake pad should be hard enough that it does not embed road grit or chips of rim metal in the face of the pad , since these act as grinding/gouging agents and markedly reduce rim life types of rim brakes some of the more unusual results can be seen here the '' rod-actuated brake '' , or simply '' rod brake '' , ( roller lever brake in raleigh terminology ) uses a series of rods and pivots , rather than bowden cables , to transmit force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface , which faces the hub , of the wheel rim one arm pivots at the centre , like a side-pull ; and the other pivots at the side , like a centre-pull the cable housing attaches like that of a side-pull brake the difference is that the two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes this location usually benefits from higher frame stiffness , an important consideration with a powerful brake since flex in the stays will increase lever travel and reduce effective braking force u-brakes are the current standard on freestyle bmx frames and forks both first- and second-class lever designs exist ; second-class is by far the most common in the first-class lever design , the arm pivots above the rim the cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable , causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads when the mountain bike became popular , cantilever brakes were adopted for these too but the smaller mtb frames meant that riders often fouled the rear brake arms with their heels low profile brakes require more careful attention to cable geometry than traditional cantilevers but are now the most common type however , the arms are longer , with the cable housing attached to one arm and the cable to the other the noodle seats in a stirrup attached to the arm some high-end v-brakes use a four-pivot parallel motion so the brake pads contact at virtually the same position on the wheel rim regardless of wear as a general rule , mechanical disc brakes for so-called '' flat bar '' bicycles ( chiefly mountain and hybrid bicycles ) are compatible with v-brake levers , whereas mechanical disc brakes intended for '' drop-bar '' bicycles are compatible with the cable pull of older brake designs ( cantilever , caliper , and u-brake ) the stirrup can not normally be replaced , so good-quality v-brakes use a durable metal for the stirrup '' mini v-brakes '' ( or '' mini v 's '' ) are v-brakes with shorter arms , typically between 8 and 9 centimeters on the downside , their shorter arms provide very small tyre and wheel clearance and generally make for a less forgiving setup : they can only accommodate smaller tyre sizes compared to cantilever brakes , may pose problems for mounting fenders , can be clogged more easily by mud , and they can make it harder to change wheels '' roller cam brakes '' are centre-pull cantilever brakes actuated by the cable pulling a single two-sided sliding cam ) each arm has a cam follower they are known for being strong and controllable drawings and technical description the cable attaches to one of the three holes as the cam presses against the follower , the force is also transmitted to the other arm via the link the cable enters at the centre , pulls a corner of a parallelogram linkage housed inside the brake across two opposite corners , pushing out at the other two corners on to the brake arms above the pivots , so that the arms below the pivots push pads in against the rim some e-bikes continue to use them since they are powerful , relatively low-maintenance and weight is less of an issue when electric assistance is available longer arms tend to flex more , degrading braking disc brakes are unaffected by tyre width wheel size optionality with disc brakes allows the rider more options , including using a smaller diameter rim-sized wheel ( such as 27.5+ ) with a higher volume wider tire with the same outer diameter size as a larger rim-sized wheel ( such as 29 '' ) -- the outer diameter consistency is important as it preserves the geometry of the frame between the two different wheel sizes as advantages of cable-actuated disc brakes are argued lower cost , lower maintenance , and lighter system weight , hydraulic disc brakes are said to offer more braking power and better control many incompatible variants were produced over the years , mostly by fork manufacturers . advantages and disadvantages of various types of mounts frame manufacturers have standardized the is mount for the rear disc brake mount is is a six-bolt mount and is the industry standard some of the disadvantages are that the design is patented requiring a licensing fee from shimano a shimano cassette lockring tool ( or an external bb tool in case of through-axle hub ) is needed to remove the rotor and is more expensive and less common than a torx key
