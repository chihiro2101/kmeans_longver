that is , given the first k bits of a random sequence , there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can predict the ( k +1 ) th bit with probability of success non-negligibly better than 50 % most prngs are not suitable for use as csprngs and will fail on both counts : when the maximum number of bits output from this prng is equal to the 2 blocksize , the resulting output delivers the mathematically expected security level that the key size would be expected to generate , but the output is shown to not be indistinguishable from a true random number generator there are also standards for statistical testing of new csprng designs : a statistical test suite for random and pseudorandom number generators , nist special publication 800-22 rsa security received a 10 million payment from the nsa to do so on october 23 , 2017 , shaanan cohney , matthew green , and nadia heninger , cryptographers at the university of pennsylvania and johns hopkins university released details of the duhk ( do n't use hard-coded keys ) attack on wpa2 where hardware vendors use a hardcoded seed key for the ansi x9.31 rng algorithm in conjunction with the usage of the ansi x9.31 random number generator , '' an attacker can brute-force encrypted data to discover the rest of the encryption parameters and deduce the master encryption key used to encrypt web sessions or virtual private network ( vpn ) connections during world war ii , japan used a cipher machine used for diplomatic communications ; the united states was able to type b cipher machine purple , mostly because the '' key values '' used were insufficiently random cryptographically secure random number on windows without using cryptoapi conjectured security of the ansi-nist elliptic curve rng , daniel r brown and kristian gjosteen , iacr eprint 2007/048 to appear in crypto 2007
