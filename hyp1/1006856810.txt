cleland ( 1921 ) , ch two colors of equal value and chroma , on opposite sides of a hue circle , are complementary colors , and mix additively to the neutral gray of the same value 2 neutral grays lie along the vertical axis between black and white this led to a wide range of possible chroma levels—up to the high 30s for some hue–value combinations ( though it is difficult or impossible to make physical objects in colors of such high chromas , and they can not be reproduced on current computer displays ) several different shapes for such a solid were proposed , including : a double triangular pyramid by tobias mayer in 1758 , a single triangular pyramid by johann heinrich lambert in 1772 , a sphere by philipp otto runge in 1810 , a hemisphere by michel eugène chevreul in 1839 , a cone by hermann von helmholtz in 1860 , a tilted cube by william benson in 1868 , and a slanted double cone by august kirschmann in 1895 7 which he could use to teach his students about color these were improved significantly in the 1929 munsell book of color and through an extensive series of experiments carried out by the optical society of america in the 1940s resulting in the notations ( sample definitions ) for the modern munsell book of color macevoy ( 2005 ) landa ( 2005 ) , pp munsell.com , the homepage of munsell color , a subdivision of x-rite , current owners of the munsell color company munsell page at the x-rite website munsell color science laboratory at the rochester institute of technology , an academic laboratory dedicated to color science , endowed by the munsell foundation
