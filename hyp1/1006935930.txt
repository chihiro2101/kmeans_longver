chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von n√§geli in 1842 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 bulletin of the tiflis botanical garden evolution of genetic systems oliver & boyd , edinburgh and michael jd white animal cytology and evolution 3rd ed , cambridge university press joe hin tjio working in albert levan 's lab found the chromosome count to be 46 using new techniques available at the time : using cells in tissue culture pretreating cells in a hypotonic solution , which swells them and spreads the chromosomes arresting mitosis in metaphase by a solution of colchicine squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram the work took place in 1955 , and was published in 1956 human and mammalian cytogenetics : a historical perspective the other great apes have 48 chromosomes usually , a suitable dye , such as giemsa , a preparation which includes the dyes methylene blue , eosin y and azure-a , b , c is applied after cells have been arrested during cell division by a solution of colchicine usually in metaphase or prometaphase when most condensed these differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread heterochromatin is packed tighter although the replication and transcription of dna is highly standardized in eukaryotes , the same can not be said for their karyotypes , which are highly variable this variation provides the basis for a range of studies in evolutionary cytology in a review , godfrey and masters conclude : although much is known about karyotypes at the descriptive level , and it is clear that changes in karyotype organization has had effects on the evolutionary course of many species , it is quite unclear what the general significance might be in some species , as in many sciaridae , entire chromosomes are eliminated during development sinauer associates , stamford ct the low record is held by the nematode parascaris univalens , where the haploid n 1 ; and an ant : myrmecia pilosula the high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns , with the adder 's tongue fern ophioglossum ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes it is a common arrangement in the hymenoptera , and in some other groups the cells do not always contain exact multiples ( powers of two ) , which is why the simple definition 'an increase in the number of chromosome sets caused by replication without cell division ' is not quite accurate this process ( especially studied in insects and some higher plants such as maize ) may be a developmental strategy for increasing the productivity of tissues which are highly active in biosynthesis elsevier , new york p18 in primates , the great apes have 24x2 chromosomes whereas humans have 23x2 the polytene banding of the 'picture wing ' group , the best-studied group of hawaiian drosophilids , enabled carson to work out the evolutionary tree long before genome analysis was practicable the results are clear the inversions , when plotted in tree form ( and independent of all other information ) , show a clear '' flow '' of species from older to newer islands the oldest member of the hawaiian archipelago still above the sea is kure atoll , which can be dated to 30 mya chromosomes display a banded pattern when treated with some stains unique banding patterns are used to identify chromosomes and to diagnose chromosomal aberrations , including chromosome breakage , loss , duplication , translocation or inverted segments cytogenetics employs several techniques to visualize different aspects of chromosomes : g-banding is obtained with giemsa stain following digestion of chromosomes with trypsin c-banding : giemsa binds to constitutive heterochromatin , so it stains centromeres.the name is derived from centromeric or constitutive heterochromatin since regions rich in at are more common in heterochromatin than in euchromatin , these regions are labelled preferentially fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or , in the case of spectral karyotyping , by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope numerical abnormalities , also known as aneuploidy , often occur as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis in the formation of a gamete ; trisomy , in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two , are common numerical abnormalities edwards syndrome is caused by trisomy ( three copies ) of chromosome 18 prader-willi syndrome & ndash ; 50 % of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing ; a deletion of the paternal genes , example of imprinting disorder
