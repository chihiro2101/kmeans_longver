upnp was published as a 73-part international standard , iso/iec 29341 , in december , 2008 ; extensibility : each upnp product can have device-specific services layered on top of the basic architecture responses to search requests are also sent over udp , but are instead sent using unicast ( known as httpu ) httpu and httpmu were initially submitted as an internet draft but it expired in 2001 ; these specifications have since been integrated into the actual upnp specifications if during the dhcp transaction , the device obtains a domain name , for example , through a dns server or via dns forwarding , the device should use that name in subsequent network operations ; otherwise , the device should use its ip address the upnp device description is expressed in xml and includes vendor-specific manufacturer information like the model name and number , serial number , manufacturer name , ( presentation ) urls to vendor-specific web sites , etc to do this , a control point sends a suitable control message to the control url for the service ( provided in the device description ) a special initial event message is sent when a control point first subscribes ; this event message contains the names and values for all evented variables and allows the subscriber to initialize its model of the state of the service in march 2013 , an updated upnp av architecture specification was published , incorporating the updated device control protocols upnp av media servers can either be categorized as software-based or hardware-based hardware-based upnp av media servers may run on any nas devices or any specific hardware for delivering media , such as a dvr that means that one can control a home networking device through any web browser-based communications method for ce devices on a upnp home network using ethernet and a special version of html called ce-html quality of service refers to control mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or data flows , or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow in accordance with requests from the application program traffic specification ( tspec ) which contains a set of parameters that define the characteristics of the traffic stream , ( for example operating requirement and scheduling ) one solution for nat traversal , called the internet gateway device protocol ( igd protocol ) , is implemented via upnp many routers and firewalls expose themselves as internet gateway devices , allowing any local upnp control point to perform a variety of actions , including retrieving the external ip address of the device , enumerating existing port mappings , and adding or removing port mappings access from the internet in 2011 , researcher daniel garcia developed a tool designed to exploit a flaw in some upnp igd device stacks that allow upnp requests from the internet a team scanned for signals from upnp-enabled devices announcing their availability for internet connection some 6900 network-aware products from 1500 companies at 81 million ip-addresses responded to their requests igmp snooping and reliability ocf had published a fix to the protocol specification in april 2020 , but since many devices running upnp are not easily upgradable , callstranger is likely to remain a threat for a long time to come in the fall of 2008 , the upnp forum ratified the successor to upnp 1.0 device architecture upnp 1.1 the devices profile for web services ( dpws ) standard was a candidate successor to upnp , but upnp 1.1 was selected by the upnp forum version 2 of igd is standardized the upnp internet gateway device ( igd ) standard has a wanipconnection service , which provides similar functionality to ietf-standard port control protocol
