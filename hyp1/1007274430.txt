in the 1840s , railway mania was gripping the country , with many speculative schemes being proposed the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level over 200,000 tons were carried in 1848 , the highest recorded total the railway 's carrying business on this and other canals ceased shortly afterwards prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards by 1905 , traffic had dropped to 45,177 tons , of which around 15,000 tons were coal and 11,000 were bricks the largest drain on resources was the norwood tunnel , where £21,000 had been spent since 1871 , in an attempt to repair damage and raise the roof various attempts to reduce the growth of weed , which had first appeared on the canal in 1852 , were made , with variable success , and there was a brisk trade in munitions during the second world war the british transport commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962 , although the lockgates from worksop to kiveton were removed , and the lock walls bulldozed , on the grounds of public safety clarke formed the retford and worksop ( chesterfield canal ) boat club soon afterwards , and it became a limited company in 1966 , to cope with the growing membership unofficial work parties were organised , to clear locks and cut back vegetation and weed ; they were unofficial because the british transport commission would not allow volunteers to work on their property by 1968 , restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the chesterfield canal was mentioned in the may edition of the bulletin , produced for members of the inland waterways association ( iwa ) by the forerunners of the waterway recovery group some 150 boats and over 21,000 people attended , with catering services , theatrical performances and exhibitions held on the bracebridge showground rotherham borough council were hoping to obtain similar grants for the section between the aqueduct and the norwood tunnel , but the funding came from the heritage lottery fund and the regeneration agency english partnerships the last few miles of the canal , from chesterfield to staveley , were in reasonable condition , although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access , while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass , which had first been proposed in 1927 a breach in the canal in march 2007 , caused by the collapse of a culvert carrying the tinkersick brook under the canal , forced temporary closure of all but the top pound above tapton lock for about six weeks the development of the site ceased in 2010 , when there were issues with ownership of the land since then , there have been issues with vandalism , and the lack of a natural water supply has been a continuing problem the first bridge over the canal in this location was further to the east , and was erected in the 1850s , when the canal arm to speedwell colliery was filled in , to be converted to a railway the first boat passed through the lock on 26 may , and it was officially opened on 28 may although the track on the mineral line has been removed , its route may be reused to provide access to a maintenance depot , for the high speed 2 ( hs2 ) railway project this will provide housing and amenities in an area which is currently derelict land in april 2012 , the project was awarded a £2.4 & nbsp ; million grant by the sheffield city region local enterprise partnership board with the canal open from west stockwith to the eastern portal of norwood tunnel , and from chesterfield to staveley , there were less than left to be restored by 2017 at the time , the eastern route was felt to be the best option , and consultation with residents resulted in that route being included in the north east derbyshire local plan although a small section of it at the eastern end may be reused as part of the restoration , most of it will remain abandoned , as it has suffered from subsidence , and parts of it have been filled in in order to allow it to be navigated by wide-beam boats , it was built wide and high this would provide a way to reach the chesterfield canal without negotiating the tidal river trent , and would create a new cruising ring , taking in the rother link , river don navigation , stainforth and keadby canal , river trent , and chesterfield canal the water drained ( as designed ) harmlessly into the nearby river idle
