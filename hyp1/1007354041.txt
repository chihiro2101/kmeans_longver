however , such mixtures , which can appear superficially similar , are caused by a number of separate genetic factors duns , which are solid-colored horses affected by the dun dilution gene on their bodies but with darker points , are also sometimes confused with roans , but they do not have the intermixed white and colored hairs of a roan horses with the classic or true roan pattern may be any base color which is intermingled with unpigmented white hairs on the body except for horse markings under the control of other genes , the head , mane , tail , and lower legs are dark roan is a simple dominant trait symbolized by the rn allele descriptions of roan coat colors are as follows : red roan or strawberry roan describes true or classic roan on a chestnut base coat geneticists prefer the term '' chestnut roan , '' but this term is not in common use any other coat color may also be affected by roaning a varnish roan is not a true roan ; it is actually one of the leopard complex coat patterns associated with appaloosa , knabstrupper , noriker horse and related breeds the roan or ticked color is described in many breeds of gundogs such as english cocker spaniels , american cocker spaniels , english springer spaniels , field spaniels and brittanys , german longhaired pointers , german shorthaired pointers , bracco italiano , spinone italiano , lagotto romagnolo , english setters , small münsterländer as well as border collies and many other breeds in breeds that are characterized by roaning and ticking such as the large munsterlander , clear white-marked individuals may be called plated mast cell growth factor promotes melanin production by melanocyte , and without it , skin and hair cells lack pigment with two functional mgf genes ( homozygous dominant ) , cattle are fully pigmented ; without any functional mgf genes ( homozygous recessive ) , they are white about 25 % of guinea pigs born to two roans are completely white , having two copies of the '' roan '' allele , and may have a constellation of deformities associated with '' lethal white syndrome '' , although this condition has no relation to overo lethal white syndrome in horses or double merle syndrome in dogs
