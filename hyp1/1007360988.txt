the genera pristiancistrus , thysanocara and xenocara are now synonyms of ancistrus ( 2001 ) : the biology of hypogean fishes there are currently 76 recognized species in this genus : the eggs hatch in 4–10 days over a period of 2–6 hours ; the male guards the eggs for 7–10 days after hatching males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other , head to tail , with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted a male bristlenose may guard several clutches of eggs simultaneously their recommended temperature 23–27 degrees celsius they are hardy animals , tolerant to a wide range of water conditions though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color , other species are more exotic & nbsp ; – spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern aquarium specimens may starve for lack of algae or other plant matter ; algae wafers or other low-protein foods are recommended breeding is also possible caution should be taken with the spines ( odontodes ) & nbsp ; ; although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus , the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting list of freshwater aquarium fish species
