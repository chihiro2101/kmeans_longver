therefore , the test does not falsify the theory yet here he is demanding that scientists do an actual experiment with actual bacteria , the numbers of which could not possibly be contained in a lab , on the evolution of a much more complex biochemical system that would almost certainly take longer to evolve than the whole of recorded human history if the results with knock-out mice ( bugge et al further , i find the idea of common descent ( that all organisms share a common ancestor ) fairly convincing , and have no particular reason to doubt it '' the edge of evolution , pp 2 in 1997 , russell doolittle , on whose work behe based much of the blood-clotting discussion in darwin 's black box , wrote a rebuttal to the statements about irreducible complexity of certain systems in reviewing a book by robert t in 2001 pennock responded that he had been careful to represent their views correctly , and that while several leaders of the intelligent design movement were young earth creationists , others including behe were '' old-earthers '' and '' creationists in the core sense of the term , namely , that they reject the scientific , evolutionary account of the origin of species and want to replace it with a form of special creation numerous scientists have debunker the work , pointing out that not only has it been shown that a supposedly irreducibly complex structure can evolve , but that it can do so within a reasonable time even subject to unrealistically harsh restrictions , and noting that behe and snoke 's paper does not properly include natural selection and genetic redundancy . the edge of evolution lents , richard lenski , and s dembski and david berlinski , tutored ann coulter on science and evolution for her book godless : the church of liberalism ( 2006 ) '' in the book , coulter thanks behe , dembski and berlinski for their assistance coulter 2007 , p dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 68 of 139 earlier during his direct testimony , behe had argued that a computer simulation of evolution he performed with snoke shows that evolution is not likely to produce certain complex biochemical systems dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 88 of 139 kitzmiller v jones iii , the judge in the case , would ultimately rule that intelligent design is not scientific in his 139-page decision , citing behe 's testimony extensively as the basis for his findings : '' consider , to illustrate , that professor behe remarkably and unmistakably claims that the plausibility of the argument for id depends upon the extent to which one believes in the existence of god '' s : kitzmiller v professor behe 's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 81 of 139 jones would later say that eric rothschild 's cross examination of behe was '' as good a cross-examination of an expert witness as i have ever seen the case was filed by association of christian schools international , which argued that the university of california was being discriminatory by not recognizing science classes that use creationism books '' united states district court for the central district of california : association of christian schools international v cv 05-06242 sjo ( manx ) ;
