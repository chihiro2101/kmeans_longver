reprinted from 1926 edition of international labour review they could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment – there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment since 1974 , seven nobel prizes have been given to economists for , among other things , work critical of some variations of the phillips curve the authors receiving those prizes include thomas sargent , christopher sims , edmund phelps , edward prescott , robert a mundell , robert e lucas , milton friedman , and f.a this result implies that over the longer-run there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment but still today , modified forms of the phillips curve that take inflationary expectations into account remain influential the '' short-run phillips curve '' is also called the '' expectations-augmented phillips curve '' , since it shifts up when inflationary expectations rise , edmund phelps and milton friedman argued however , this long-run '' neutrality '' of monetary policy does allow for short run fluctuations and the ability of the monetary authority to temporarily decrease unemployment by increasing permanent inflation , and vice versa as keynes mentioned : '' a government has to remember , however , that even if a tax is not prohibited it may be unprofitable , and that a medium , rather than an extreme , imposition will yield the greatest gain '' this relationship is often called the '' new keynesian phillips curve '' first , there is the traditional or keynesian version the traditional phillips curve story starts with a wage phillips curve , of the sort described by phillips himself here and below , the operator g is the equivalent of '' the percentage rate of growth of '' the variable that follows nairu and rational expectations edmund phelps won the nobel prize in economics in 2006 in part for this work this , in turn , suggested that the short-run period was so short that it was non-existent : any effort to reduce unemployment below the nairu , for example , would immediately cause inflationary expectations to rise and thus imply that the policy would fail however , in the 1990s in the u.s furthermore , the concept of rational expectations had become subject to much doubt when it became clear that the main assumption of models based on it was that there exists a single ( unique ) equilibrium in the economy that is set ahead of time , determined independently of demand conditions firms hire them because they see the inflation as allowing higher profits for given nominal wages some research underlines that some implicit and serious assumptions are actually in the background of the friedmanian phillips curve it is not that high inflation causes low unemployment ( as in milton friedman 's theory ) as much as vice versa : low unemployment raises worker bargaining power , allowing them to successfully push for higher nominal wages gordon 's triangle model ( this is with shift b in the diagram but if unemployment stays high and inflation stays low for a long time , as in the early 1980s in the u.s , both inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral slow in between these two lies the nairu , where the phillips curve does not have any inherent tendency to shift , so that the inflation rate is stable federal reserve bank of boston , '' understanding inflation and the implications for monetary policy : a phillips curve retrospective '' , frbb conference series 53 , june 9–11 , 2008 , chatham , massachusetts
