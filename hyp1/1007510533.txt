ix , 622a : 2-10 cited in luciana borrelli , francesca gherardi , graziano fiorito the term chromatophore was adopted ( following sangiovanni 's chromoforo ) as the name for pigment-bearing cells derived from the neural crest of cold-blooded vertebrates and cephalopods whereas all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures ( except when there has been a mutation , as in albinism ) , not all pigment-containing cells are chromatophores chromatophores that contain large amounts of yellow pteridine pigments are named xanthophores ; those with mainly red/orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores in : the pigmentary system : physiology and pathophysiology , oxford university press , 1998 given a source of white light , they produce a white shine eumelanin is generated from tyrosine in a series of catalysed chemical reactions the key enzyme in melanin synthesis is tyrosinase for this reason , and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise , melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore both types of melanophore are important in physiological colour change flat dermal melanophores often overlay other chromatophores , so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears dark numerous melanocortin , mch and melatonin receptors have been identified in fish and frogs , including a homologue of mc1r , a melanocortin receptor known to regulate skin and hair colour in humans inside the cell , cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( camp ) has been shown to be an important second messenger of pigment translocation during vertebrate embryonic development , chromatophores are one of a number of cell types generated in the neural crest , a paired strip of cells arising at the margins of the neural tube fish melanophores and iridophores have been found to contain the smooth muscle regulatory proteins calponin and caldesmon these are not derived from the neural crest this is seen as a useful model system for understanding patterning in the evolutionary developmental biology field recently , the gene responsible for the melanophore-specific golden zebrafish strain , slc24a5 , was shown to have a human equivalent that strongly correlates with skin colour therefore , pharmaceutical companies have developed a biological assay for rapidly identifying potential bioactive compounds using melanophores from the african clawed frog 2005 ; university of southern california coleoid cephalopods ( including octopuses , squids and cuttlefish ) have complex multicellular organs that they use to change colour rapidly , producing a wide variety of bright colours and patterns to change colour the animal distorts the sacculus form or size by muscular contraction , changing its translucent , reflectivity , or opacity this differs from the mechanism used in fish , amphibians , and reptiles in that the shape of the sacculus is changed , rather than translocating pigment vesicles within the cell
