the bell redirects exhaust moving in the wrong direction so that it generates thrust in the correct direction instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell , an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion , the '' spike '' , which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell the recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 bar , higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle , thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases several versions of the design exist , differentiated by their shapes in the toroidal aerospike the spike is bowl-shaped with the exhaust exiting in a ring around the outer rim in theory this requires an infinitely long spike for best efficiency , but by blowing a small amount of gas out of the center of a shorter truncated spike ( like base bleed in an artillery shell ) , something similar can be achieved the rs-2200 was to power the venturestar single-stage-to-orbit vehicle the development on the rs-2200 was formally halted in early 2001 when the x-33 program did not receive space launch initiative funding further progress came in march 2004 when two successful tests sponsored by the nasa dryden flight research centre using high-power rockets manufactured by blacksky corporation , based in carlsbad , california the plug-cluster aerospike engine puts out of thrust they later announced that their executor aerospike engine would produce of thrust at sea level and of thrust in a vacuum in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine they announced a flight for august 2017 . ksf space and interstellar space
