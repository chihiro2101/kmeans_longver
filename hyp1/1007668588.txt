instead , the selby canal flows northwards from haddlesey to the ouse at selby the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder the locks were long by wide with depths over the sills capital to fund the scheme had been raised separately by the wakefield and leeds committees a complicated restructuring of the finances in 1721 fixed the nominal capital at £26,700 despite this , the general profitability of the navigation led the undertakers to be complacent about its development with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford 96 with a few amendments all locks were replaced , and the total cost was over £60,000 , of which around £20,000 was for the selby canal canal boats were limited to about 60 tons , whereas ships of up to 200 tons could reach selby with revenue from tolls reaching £82,092 in 1818 , which enabled a dividend of £54,000 to be paid , the company was in a healthy state , and proposed their own route from haddlesey to the dutch river in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available the new section was long , with locks at ferrybridge , whitley , pollington and goole faced with yet another outside scheme which would bypass the navigation from wakefield to ferrybridge , the company looked at improvements which would give of water all the way to both leeds and wakefield thomas telford surveyed both routes , and it became the basis for an act of parliament which was passed in june 1828 receipts dropped by one-third between 1851 and 1856 the people now call them 'tom puddings ' from their wobbling gait in 1880 they carried 151,860 tons , and by 1913 there were 18 tugs , 1,010 compartments , and 1,560,006 tons were carried , 33 times warde-aldam 's original estimate there is some variation in lock sizes , with the smallest being at knostrop , which is with a water depth of over the lock cill locks on the wakefield section can accommodate vessels which are with a draught of , though rigid vessels are constrained to 141 & nbsp ; ft to enable turning at wakefield while the locks below castleford have three sets of gates , so that a section can be used , rather than the full required by the compartment boats an act of parliament was obtained to allow of new waterway to be constructed starting in 1967 , cawoods hargreaves used trains of three tubs or coal pans , which were rigidly connected , and pushed by a tug when loaded coal carrying came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the st aidan 's opencast mine was exhausted and the coal from kellingley colliery was found to have levels of sulphur content high above the acceptable limit the aire and calder was built for commercial freight , and although the volume carried has dropped significantly , particularly since coal deliveries to ferrybridge power station by canal stopped , the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007 , down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000 the eastern part of the navigation , sometimes known as the knottingley and goole canal , is rather different : it has long straight stretches , but mainly through flat land that has always been agricultural with the possible restoration of the barnsley canal and the dearne and dove canal , the section between wakefield and the new junction canal might become part of a new '' yorkshire ring ''
