some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution others , such as h constitutional precedence has even established the unwritten but binding rule that the monarch must give assent to any parliamentary decision , regardless of any other considerations ( which can only be advanced in private audience with government members , not imposed ) , as soon as the government presents it for royal signature and thus assumes full political responsibility while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis on 11 november 1975 , when the governor-general of australia sir john kerr 1975 australian constitutional crisis cited in geoff barlow & jf corkery , '' sir walter campbell queensland governor and his role in premier joh bjelke-petersen 's resignation , 1987 '' , 23 , introduction by zelman cowen , 1967 ; 3rd ed donald markwell , the crown and australia , university of london , 1987 - on the second occasion , which took place in 1925 and came to be known as the king-byng affair , prime minister william lyon mackenzie king , facing a non-confidence motion in the house of commons , advised the governor general , the viscount byng of vimy , to dissolve the new parliament , but byng refused clark had advised guichon to dissolve the legislature as , in her view , the appointment of a speaker would have resulted in frequent tie votes and an untenable position '' the honourable john c legislative assembly of alberta retrieved on 22 april 2007 it may also be exercised if a prime minister no-confidence motion and resigns instead of advising a dissolution of parliament ; the last such occasion was in 1912 today , however , the practice of appointing – on prime ministerial advice – a permanent deputy prime minister , who becomes acting prime minister when needed , has largely removed even this discretion from the governor-general a governor-general can also refuse a prime minister 's request to dissolve parliament and hold elections many constitutional commentators believe that the governor-general ( or the sovereign ) no longer has the power to refuse royal assent to any bill properly passed by the house of representatives - former law professor and prime minister sir geoffrey palmer and professor matthew palmer argue any refusal of royal assent would lead to a constitutional crisis others , such as professor philip joseph , believe the governor-general does retain the power to refuse royal assent to bills in exceptional circumstances - such as the abolition of democracy there have been a handful of occasions when reserve powers were used , or at least considered this incident markedly reduced the discretionary powers of the governor saint kitts and nevis except where he is required to act ( c ) in accordance with the advice of any other person or authority '' tuvalu ’ s parliament convenes july 30 '' , islands business , 3 july 2013 the constitution of spain does not specifically grant emergency powers to the government , though does state in article 56 that the monarch '' arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions '' , and invests the monarch with the responsibility of overseeing that the forms of the constitution are observed the spanish constitution of 1978 , title ii the crown , article 62 , delineates the powers of the king , while title iv government and administration , article 99 , defines the king 's role in government to sanction and promulgate the laws b to exercise supreme command of the armed forces i to exercise the high patronage of the royal academies following the general election of the cortes generales ( cortes ) , and other circumstances provided for in the constitution , the king meets with and interviews the political party leaders represented in the congress of deputies , and then consults with the congress of deputies ( spain ) ( officially , presidente de congreso de los diputados de españa , who , in this instance , represents the whole of the cortes generales ) before nominating his candidate for the presidency , according to section 99 of title iv después de cada renovación del congreso de los diputados , y en los demás supuestos constitucionales en que así proceda , el rey , previa consulta con los representantes designados por los grupos políticos con representación parlamentaria , y a través del presidente del congreso , propondrá un candidato a la presidencia del gobierno reserve powers can also be written into a republican constitution that separates the offices of head of state and head of government this was the case in germany under the weimar republic and is still the case in the french fifth republic , the italy republic , and the republic of ireland the president of bangladesh must consult with the prime minister for all decisions except the appointment of the prime minister and the chief justice on a larger scale , this is consistent with a tradition of the roman republic ( which has always been an inspiration for the successive french republics ) , to give six months of dictatorial power to a citizen in case of an imminent danger of invasion however , in case of a '' legislative emergency '' the german president can accept legislation without approval of the '' bundestag '' ( parliament ) president gustav heinemann dissolved the bundestag at the request of chancellor willy brandt in 1972 , and in 1982 president karl carstens did so at the request of chancellor helmut kohl both brandt and kohl were reelected with larger majorities this reserve power has been used 8 times as of may 2013 the refusal of a pardon does not need a countersignature the question of whether or not the taoiseach has lost the confidence of the dáil could be a discretionary matter for the president to decide – in principle , the president could refuse to dissolve the dáil on the advice of a taoiseach who has not yet been defeated in a vote of no-confidence , but who appears likely to be defeated were such a vote to be held by the second of these powers , the president may refuse to assent to legislation passed by parliament when he or she considers it to be unconstitutional this power has been used several times by various presidents the president of the republic can refuse to sign laws he deems clearly against the constitution , while less obvious cases are dealt with later on by the constitutional court given his monocratic nature , this organ joins in itself prerogatives that in all other collegial organs are attributed collectively in the constitution , as interpreted by the jurisprudence of the constitutional court ( judgment no
