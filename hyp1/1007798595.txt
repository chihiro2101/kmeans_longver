hundreds of these lamps ( hollow worked stones ) have been found in the lascaux caves in modern-day france , dating to about 15,000 years ago oily animals ( birds and fish ) were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick candles and glass and pottery lamps were also invented the final death knell for whale oil was in 1859 , when crude oil was discovered and the petroleum industry arose some are very plain and functional , while some are pieces of art in themselves an incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvins ; daylight is around 6400 kelvins outdoors , general lighting for a parking lot may be as low as 10-20 lux ( 1-2 footcandles ) since pedestrians and motorists already used to the dark will need little light for crossing the area front lighting is also quite common , but tends to make the subject look flat as its casts almost no visible shadows it is a form of backlighting recessed lighting ( often called '' pot lights '' in canada , '' can lights '' or 'high hats '' in the us ) is popular , with fixtures mounted into the ceiling structure so as to appear flush with it downlights can be incandescent , fluorescent , high-intensity discharge lamp or led some manufacturers are designing led and photovoltaic luminaires to provide an energy-efficient alternative to traditional street light fixtures online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 field test delta snapshot : led street lighting volume 9 , issue 3 van derlofske , j , jd bullough , j watkinson found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle 's direction of travel to following drivers commonly called 'light bulbs ' , lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture , which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation fluorescent light : a tube coated with phosphor containing low pressure mercury vapor that produces white light khan n , abas n renewable & sustainable energy reviews serial online . on stage and set lighting illuminates the performers and artists in a live theatre , dance , or musical performance , and is selected and arranged to create dramatic effects especially in the early days of these industries , very high light levels were required and heat produced by lighting equipment presented substantial challenges measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source , along with the colors that can be rendered by this light luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction the si unit of illuminance and luminous emittance , being the luminous power per area , is measured in lux nist guide to si units - 9 rules and style conventions for spelling unit names , national institute of standards and technology several measurement methods have been developed to control glare resulting from indoor lighting design koga , '' effect of local background luminance on discomfort glare , building environ 2004 ;

the greater the gai , the greater the apparent saturation or vividness of the object colors this is the first device created to accurately measure and characterize light ( intensity , spectrum , timing , and duration ) entering the eye that affects the human body 's clock the small , head-mounted device measures an individual 's daily rest and activity patterns , as well as exposure to short-wavelength light that stimulates the circadian system several strategies are available to minimize energy requirements for lighting a building : specification of illumination requirements for each given use area analysis of lighting quality to ensure that adverse components of lighting ( for example , glare or incorrect color spectrum ) are not biasing the design integration of space planning and interior architecture ( including choice of interior surfaces and room geometries ) to lighting design design of time of day use that does not expend unnecessary energy selection of fixtures and lamps that reflect best available technology for energy conservation training of building occupants to use lighting equipment in most efficient manner maintenance of lighting systems to minimize energy wastage use of natural light some big box stores were being built from 2006 on with numerous plastic bubble skylights , in many cases completely obviating the need for interior artificial lighting for many hours of the day clearly , much less light is required to illuminate a hallway compared to that needed for a word processing work station lighting control systems reduce energy usage and cost by helping to provide light only when and where it is needed these technologies are helpful , but they do have their downfalls doors , partitions , stairways , etc the best applications for passive infrared occupancy sensors are open spaces with a clear view of the area being scanned a break in the pattern caused by any motion in the area triggers the control ryckaert w , lootens c , geldof j , hanselaer p daylighting has also been proven to have positive effects on patients in hospitals as well as work and school performance analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used not only will greater reliance on natural light reduce energy consumption , but will favorably impact human health and performance when those patterns are disrupted , they disrupt the natural circadian cycle building research & information serial online march 2009 ;
