an example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed owl ( or similar predator ) is put into the cage , the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator the pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful bransford , 2000 , pp associative learning is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events in classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own in operant conditioning , a reinforcement ( by reward ) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior , changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications the first time pavlov rang the bell , the neutral stimulus , the dogs did not salivate , but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate for example , it is seen in honeybees , in the proboscis extension reflex paradigm skinner 's radical behaviorism watson 's most famous , and controversial , experiment was '' little albert '' , where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles this is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans , but is mostly limited to mammals and birds all types of play generate thinking and problem-solving skills in children grusec , joan e ; hastings , paul d collaborative practices in the mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience boston : pearson education , inc & gage , n.m london : elsevier ltd episodic memory remembers events and history that are embedded in experience and this is distinguished from semantic memory , which attempts to extract facts out of their experiential context or – as some describe – a timeless organization of knowledge electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning student-teacher communication ) , and learner–content ( i.e intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners ' understanding , perceptions , and cognitive structures ) ) , theoretical principles of distance education ( pp meaningful learning is the concept that learned knowledge ( e.g , and dale , m they may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses , on the condition they prepare , contribute , share , and can prove this offered valuable new insight , helped to acquire new skills , a place to get experience in organizing , teaching , etc tangential learning is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy for example , after playing a music-based video game , some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument , or after watching a tv show that references faust and lovecraft , some people may be inspired to read the original work this learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor 's plans and the student 's expectations an instructor prompts the student to respond if needed this type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses psychomotor : to dance , swim , ski , dive , drive a car , ride a bike , etc these domains are not mutually exclusive cued , primed , and guided furthermore , perkins and salomon ( 1992 ) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving , and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks , such as second or third-language learning finally , schwarz , bransford and sears ( 2005 ) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote ; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body , fatigue i.e these are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected home is a place where a family lives the tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed , from the display and writing surfaces ( blackboards , markerboards , tack surfaces ) to digital technologies a goal that occurs or is done at once is called an immediate goal , and distant goals are those that take time to achieve interest : this is a quality that arouses a feeling muscular and sensory fatigues are bodily fatigue mental fatigue is in the central nervous system attitude : it is a way of thinking retention is the act of retaining learning activities : learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher , his concept of discipline , methods of teaching , and above all his overall personality guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non-learning the underlying molecular basis of learning appears to be dynamic changes in gene expression occurring in brain neurons that are introduced by epigenetic mechanisms epigenetic regulation of gene expression involves , most notably , chemical modification of dna or dna-associated histone proteins an example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk however , in other scenarios the opposite is true—animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge essentially , the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation , or whether it innately knew the information however , if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it , then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves however , in environments where change occurs within an animal 's lifetime but is not constant , learning is more likely to evolve learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation , but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time therefore , learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing in each case , there was a fan blowing lightly down the tube in either the same or opposite arm as the light during the testing phase of gagliano 's experiment , the pea seedlings were placed in different y-pipes and exposed to the fan alone the majority of plants in both experimental conditions grew in a direction consistent with the predicted location of light based on the position of the fan the previous day describes a hypothesis that describes photoreception as the basis of mechano-perception in plants ca2+ permeable ion channels are “ stretch-gated ” and allow for the influx of osmolytes and calcium , a well-known second messenger , into the cell gagliano hypothesizes that the basis of associative learning in pisum sativum is the coupling of mechanosensory and photosensory pathways and is mediated by auxin signaling pathways a direction for future research is testing whether circadian rhythms in plants modulate learning and behavior and surveying researchers ' definitions of “ cognition ” and “ learning most of the machine learning models are based on probabilistic theories where each input ( eg : an image ) will result a probability to become the desired output
