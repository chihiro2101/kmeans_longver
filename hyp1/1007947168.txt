the diagrams in this book were very unclear , and often only showed the end result of the folding process , leaving the folder unsure how the model was created in the 1950s and '60s , akira yoshizawa proposed a system of diagramming he introduced its diagramming notation in his first published monograph , atarashi origami geijutsu ( new origami art ) in 1954 he employed dotted and dashed lines to represent mountain and valley folds , and a few other symbols such as the “ inflate ” and “ round ” symbols this system caught the attention of samuel randlett and robert harbin , who added a few symbols such as “ rotate ” and “ zoom in ” , and then adopted it as the standard fold two radial folds from opposite corners along the same side of the reference crease ; the resulting flap should be folded downwards so that the previous edges are aligned squash-fold.svg squash fold applied to one flap of a waterbomb base rabbit-ear-fold.svg rabbit ear fold petal-fold.svg petal fold on one half of a preliminary fold the resulting base will then have more points available for folding it is sometimes called the square base the bird base , or crane base , consists of a preliminary fold with both the front and the back sides petal folded upward however , generally swivel folds involve a flap of paper '' swivelling '' at a certain point or vertex and another flap or edge of paper , connected to the first , dragged around that point or vertex ) after forming the bird base , either partially unfold the paper , and/or '' stretch '' two opposite corners of the bird base it is a sinked analog of the crimp fold this technique is illustrated in the origami forum 's thread 462 marie 's rose demonstrates this on a pentagon it is more difficult than the closed unsink below because there is no internal flap to grab onto to help unsink the paper , so the paper must be opened out and the area to be unsunk is pushed out ( to be convex ) from inside the model and from behind in practice , it is very difficult , because the paper being '' popped '' into place usually must be pulled ( not pushed ) , and because it involves simultaneously folding over a locking flap that is hidden inside the sink the closed unsink appears in some complex models , such as a few of lang 's insects mineola , ny : dover publications origami from angelfish to zen origami design secrets : mathematical methods for an ancient art natick , ma : a k peter unit origami : multidimensional transformations
