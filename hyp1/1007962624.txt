in the southern hemisphere , the magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants , including south sea islanders and indigenous australians henrietta swan leavitt , an astronomer at the harvard college observatory , used the plates from arequipa to study the variations in relative luminosity of stars in the smc leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness this scenario leads to strings of x-ray outbursts with typical x-ray luminosities l x & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 10 36 â€“10 37 & nbsp ; erg/s , spaced at the orbital period , plus infrequent giant outbursts of greater duration and luminosity recent studies using xmm-newton haberl et al 2008 ; haberl & pietsch 2004 and chandra antoniou et al the fourth uhuru catalog lists an early x-ray source within the constellation tucana : 4u 0115-73 ( 3u 0115-73 , 2a 0116-737 , smc x-1 ) some x-ray counts were also received on january 14 , 15 , 18 , and 19 , 1971 two additional sources detected and listed in 3a include smc x-2 at 3a 0042-738 and smc x-3 at 3a 0049-726 nasa extragalactic database entry on the smc seds entry on the smc smc at esa/hubble astronomy picture of the day 2010 january 7 the tail of the small magellanic cloud - likely stripped from the galaxy by gravitational tides , the tail contains mostly gas , dust , and newly formed stars a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud
