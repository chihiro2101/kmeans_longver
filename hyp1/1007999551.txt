the words '' repent , '' '' repentance , '' and '' repented '' are mentioned over 100 times in the bible talmud bavli , tractates pesahim 54a ; nedarim 39b ; midrash genesis rabbah 1 '' the holy one , blessed be his name , said to elijah , 'behold , the precious gift which i have bestowed on my world : though a man sins again and again , but returns in penitence , i will receive him 157 ; midrash deuteronomy rabbah ii ( talmud bava metsia 58b ; mishneh torah teshuva 8:8 ) repentance occupies a prominent position in all the ethical writings of the middle ages in the hebrew bible , repentance generally leads to salvation in the hebrew bible , the tanakh ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; the bible states that god 's loving-kindness is extended to the returning sinner these include pouring out water , ( i sam 12:16 ) ; self-affliction , as fasting ; wearing sackcloth ; sitting and sleeping on the ground ( i kings 21:27 ; joel 2:13 ; jonah 3:5 ) however , the prophets disparaged all such outer manifestations of repentance , insisting rather on a complete change of the sinner 's mental and spiritual attitude '' rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the lord your god : for he is gracious and full of compassion , slow to anger and plenteous in mercy , and repenteth him of the evil '' apart from repentance , no other activities , such as sacrifices or religious ceremonies can secure pardon and forgiveness of sin the greek word used for repentance in the new testament is μετάνοια ( metanoia ) , and the greek verb for '' to repent '' is μετανοῶ , contracted from μετανο-έω ( metano-eo ) , as in mark 's account of the initial preaching of jesus : '' the time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of god has come near ; repent , and trust in the good news '' in english , the prefix meta can indicate '' beyond , about '' , as '' meta-economics '' or '' meta-philosophy '' ( see meta ) , inspired by the non-greek use of the word '' metaphysics '' , which in greek was just the title of a work of aristotle , the metaphysics , so named simply because in the customary ordering of the works of aristotle it was the book following the physics ; the greek word thus meant nothing more than '' the book that comes after the book entitled physics '' it is one of the most important documents of the protestant reformation ” he further said that '' it will be useful to amplify and explain the definition we have given ; in which there are three points to be particularly considered '' in the first place , when we call repentance ' a conversion of the life to god ' , we require a transformation , not only in the external actions , but in the soul itself ; which , after having put off the old nature , should produce the fruits of actions corresponding to its renovation the act of repentance can redeem the sins and give the opportunity to go to heaven : : o you who have believed , repent to allah with sincere repentance '' at-tahriim 66:8 although repentance is considered as one act that can be used for cleansing the sins , the quran notes that all of the sins are forgiven with or without repentance except the state of shirk , i.e the buddha considered shame over doing wrong ( pali : hiri ) and fear of the consequences of wrongdoing ( pali : otappa ) as essential safeguards against falling into evil ways and further as extremely useful in the eightfold path similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the oceania , including samoa , tahiti and new zealand
