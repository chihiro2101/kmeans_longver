for example , christof koch and giulio tononi wrote in ieee spectrum : a digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion the computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations , preferably in real time when modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual , a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain however , if short-term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons , as well as intra-neural dynamic processes , the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract a possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning , in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer , which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome , thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections for example , the c elegans roundworm , drosophila fruit fly , and mouse have all been simulated to various degrees the mind or '' soul '' can be defined as the information state of the brain , and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer this is not to deny that minds are richly adapted to their substrates these issues have a long history in 1775 thomas reid wrote : “ i would be glad to know according to her views , '' uploading '' would probably result in the death of the original person 's brain , while only outside observers can maintain the illusion of the original person still being alive ordinary objects ( rocks , tables , etc ) are not simultaneously here , and elsewhere for example , buddhist transhumanist james hughes has pointed out that this consideration only goes so far : if one believes the self is an illusion , worries about survival are not reasons to avoid uploading , and keith wiley has presented an argument wherein all resulting minds of an uploading procedure are granted equal primacy in their claim to the original identity , such that survival of the self is determined retroactively from a strictly subjective position ethical and legal implications sometimes the animals would just need to be euthanized in order to extract , slice , and scan their brains , but sometimes behavioral and in vivo measures would be required , which might cause pain to living animals in addition , the resulting animal emulations themselves might suffer , depending on one 's views about consciousness he then concludes : “ if , as i argue above , a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain , it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations political and economic implications if emulations run much faster than humans , there might not be enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate the neuroscience and computer-hardware technologies that may make brain emulation possible are widely desired for other reasons , and logically their development will continue into the future arguments for slowing down brain-emulation research : greater investment in brain emulation and associated cognitive science might enhance the ability of artificial intelligence ( ai ) researchers to create '' neuromorphic '' ( brain-inspired ) algorithms , such as neural networks , reinforcement learning , and hierarchical perception emulations could more easily inherit human motivations emulations running at digital speeds would have less intelligence differential vis-à-vis ai and so might more easily control ai two intelligence explosions may mean more total risk that site has not been actively updated in recent years , but it has spawned other sites including minduploading.org , run by randal a michio kaku , in collaboration with science , hosted a documentary , sci fi science : physics of the impossible , based on his book physics of the impossible paul & earl d mind uploading in fiction brain initiative brain transplant brain-reading cyborg cylon ( reimagining ) democratic transhumanism human brain project isolated brain neuralink posthumanization robotoid ship of theseus—thought experiment asking if objects having all parts replaced fundamentally remain the same object simulation hypothesis simulism technologically enabled telepathy turing test the future of work and death
