the lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions if a typical mammalian cell ( diameter ~10 micrometers ) were magnified to the size of a watermelon ( ~1 & nbsp ; ft/30 & nbsp ; cm ) , the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper despite being only a few nanometers thick , the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section for example , when a cell undergoes apoptosis , the phosphatidylserine & nbsp ; — normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet & nbsp ; — is transferred to the outer surface : there , it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell other lipids , such as sphingomyelin , appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases , which transfer lipids in the opposite direction , and scramblases , which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers ( as in apoptotic cells ) in any case , once lipid asymmetry is established , it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric , although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very different from that in cells . phases and phase transitions the phase behavior of lipid bilayers is determined largely by the strength of the attractive van der waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules an example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter , which has a large percentage saturated fats , is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil , which is mostly unsaturated , is liquid one particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol , which modulates bilayer permeability , mechanical strength , and biochemical interactions for instance , ps presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis , whereas ps in growth plate vesicles is necessary for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization without some form of barrier delineating “ self ” from “ non-self , ” it is difficult to even define the concept of an organism or of life the nucleus , mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers , while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer ( such as the plasma membrane , endoplasmic reticula , golgi apparatus and lysosomes ) these vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins the most common class of this type of protein is the g protein-coupled receptor ( gpcr ) in spite of these limitations dozens of techniques have been developed over the last seventy years to allow investigations of its structure and function electrical measurements do not provide an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent , so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer electron microscopy offers a higher resolution image in conjunction with rapid freezing techniques , electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport , for instance in demonstrating that exocytosis vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses . nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the analysis of 31 p-nmr spectra of lipids could provide a wide range of information about lipid bilayer packing , phase transitions ( gel phase , physiological liquid crystal phase , ripple phases , non bilayer phases ) , lipid head group orientation/dynamics , and elastic properties of pure lipid bilayer and as a result of binding of proteins and other biomolecules quantum chemical calculations has recently been successfully performed to estimate dipole and quadrupole moments of lipid membranes alireza mashaghi et al transport across the bilayer anions typically have a higher rate of diffusion through bilayers than cations this applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether . ion pumps and channels alternatively , the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place , as in the sodium-calcium exchanger if these two processes were not balancing each other , the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a short time ind jl of anim sci 63 , 99-102 ( 1998 ) discovery of vesicular exocytosis in prokaryotes and its role in salmonella invasion current science , vol and microbe-environment interactions , in general for two-tailed pc lipids , this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase biochimica et biophysica acta , vol the origin of this energy is the fact that creating such an interface exposes some of the lipid tails to water , but the exact orientation of these border lipids is unknown to achieve this close contact , the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated , as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel the first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins , which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell ( enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer ; some others have only a protein coat ) snare proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking in studies of molecular and cellular biology it is often desirable to artificially induce fusion they can be made with either synthetic or natural lipids ( note- the term “ liposome ” is in essence synonymous with “ vesicle ” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles ) the basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient in theory , liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug , can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity , surface charge density , and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system the most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol ( peg ) onto the liposome surface to produce “ stealth ” vesicles , which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection ( pdf ) other , more exotic applications are also being pursued such as the use of lipid bilayer membrane pores for dna sequencing by oxford nanolabs to date , this technology has not proven commercially viable evert gorter ( 1881–1954 ) and f this was an important advance , since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure
