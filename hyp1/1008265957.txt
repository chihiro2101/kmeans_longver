king james i founded a series of '' royal schools '' in ulster , beginning with the royal school , armagh in theory these schools were open to all and offered free tuition to those who could not pay fees ; however , few poor children attended school , because their labour was economically valuable to their families the teaching of these languages was hampered by a shortage of non-latin type and of teachers fluent in the languages during the 16th and 17th centuries the setting-up of grammar schools became a common act of charity by nobles , wealthy merchants and guilds ; for example the crypt school , gloucester , founded by john and joan cook in 1539 , spalding grammar school , founded by john gamlyn and john blanche in 1588 , and blundell 's school , founded in 1604 by wealthy tiverton merchant peter blundell the school day typically ran from 6 a.m and ended at 4 p.m grammar schools in the 18th and 19th centuries a new commercial class required modern languages and commercial subjects very few schools were able to obtain special acts of parliament to change their statutes ; examples are the macclesfield grammar school act 1774 and the bolton school act 1788 after 10 years , lord eldon , then lord chancellor , ruled in 1805 , '' there is no authority for thus changing the nature of the charity , and filling a school intended for the purpose of teaching greek and latin with scholars learning the german and french languages , mathematics , and anything except greek and latin however it should be borne in mind that the decline of the grammar schools in england and wales was not uniform and that until the foundation of st bees clerical college , in 1817 , and st david 's college lampeter , in 1828 , specialist grammar schools in the north-west of england and south wales were in effect providing tertiary education to men in their late teens and early twenties , which enabled them to be ordained as anglican clergymen without going to university grammar schools were reinvented as academically oriented secondary schools following literary or scientific curricula , while often retaining classical subjects the commission reported that the distribution of schools did not match the current population , and that provision varied greatly in quality , with provision for girls being particularly limited it was said that the commission '' could turn a boys ' school in northumberland into a girls ' school in cornwall '' grammar schools thus emerged as one part of the highly varied education system of england and wales before 1944 . in the tripartite system one of the three types of school forming the tripartite system was called the grammar school , which sought to spread the academic ethos of the existing grammar schools these schools included some very old schools encouraged to participate in the tripartite system sampson ( 1971 ) , p in contrast , very few students at secondary modern schools took public examinations until the introduction of the less academic and less prestigious certificate of secondary education ( known as the cse ) in the 1960s according to anthony sampson , in his book anatomy of britain ( 1965 ) , there were structural problems within the testing process that underpinned the eleven plus which meant it tended to result in secondary modern schools being overwhelmingly dominated by the children of poor and working-class parents , while grammar schools were dominated by the children of wealthier middle-class parents in england , implementation was less even , with some counties and individual schools successfully resisting conversion or closure selection also disappeared from state-funded schools in scotland in the same period today , '' grammar school '' commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully selective state-funded schools in england and the 69 remaining in northern ireland '' new labour because britain deserves better , labour party manifesto , 1997 the education ( grammar school designation ) order 1998 , statutory instrument 1998 no the act also defined a procedure by which local communities could petition for a ballot for an end to selection at schools such systems still exist in buckinghamshire , rugby and stratford districts of warwickshire , the salisbury district of wiltshire and most of lincolnshire , kent , reading and medway these schools are often heavily oversubscribed , and award places in rank order of performance in their entry tests moreover , government education policy appears to accept the existence of some kind of hierarchy in secondary education , with specialist schools , beacon schools , academies and similar initiatives proposed as ways of raising standards the 11-plus has long been controversial , and northern ireland 's political parties have taken opposing positions in other countries or regions in the mid-19th century , private schools were established in the australian colonies to spare the wealthy classes from sending their sons to schools in britain early examples include launceston grammar school ( 1846 ) , pulteney grammar school ( 1847 ) , geelong grammar school ( 1855 ) , melbourne grammar school ( 1858 ) and hale school ( 1858 ) and the trend has continued to the present day finding the grammar schools unsuitable as preparation for university , lieutenant-governor sir john colborne founded upper canada college as a superior grammar school gidney and millar , pp initially , this was a racially segregated colonial system single-sex classes were set up for daughters of the british ruling class in 1844 , and later became raffles girls ' school , officially founded in 1879 after independence it became the raffles girls ' school ( primary school ) , distinct from the branch school established by the local government after independence , the raffles girls ' school ( secondary school ) the chijmes building has commemorative plaques for these abandoned babies the children were

existing grammar school system gifted pupils , such as winners of mathematical olympiads , international violin and piano competitions , physics olympiads and child inventors are particularly sought after grammar schools on the english and later british models were founded during the colonial period , the first being the boston latin school , founded as the latin grammar school in 1635 they also
