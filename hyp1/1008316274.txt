the cp1600 was a powerful processor for its era , implementing most of the pdp-11 minicomputer 's instruction set architecture in a microcomputer package the pic used simple microcode stored in rom to perform its tasks , and although the term risc was not used at the time , it shares some common features with risc designs the pic , however , was upgraded with an internal eprom to produce a programmable channel i/o it is generally thought that pic stands for peripheral interface controller , although general instruments ' original acronym for the initial pic1640 and pic1650 devices was '' programmable interface controller '' the latest series , pic32mz is a 32-bit mips-based microcontroller as of october 2016 , the only otp product classified as '' in production '' is the pic16hv540 pointers are implemented using a register pair : after writing an address to the fsr ( file select register ) , the indf ( indirect f ) register becomes an alias for the addressed register this '' baseline core '' does not support interrupts ; all i/o must be polled these devices are available in 6-pin smd and 8-pin dip packages ( with two pins unused ) the instruction set differs very little from the baseline devices , but the two additional opcode bits allow 128 registers and 2048 words of code to be directly addressed the mid-range core is available in the majority of devices labeled pic12 and pic16 the 17 series introduced a number of important new features : a memory mapped accumulator read access to code memory ( table reads ) direct register to register moves ( prior cores needed to move registers through the accumulator ) an external program memory interface to expand the code space an 8-bit × 8-bit hardware multiplier a second indirect register pair auto-increment/decrement addressing controlled by control bits in a status register ( alusta ) a significant limitation was that ram space was limited to 256 bytes ( 26 bytes of special function registers , and 232 bytes of general-purpose ram ) , with awkward bank-switching in the models that supported more if interrupts are disabled , they may also be used on subroutine call/return by setting the s bit ( appending '' , fast '' to the instruction ) the auto increment/decrement feature was improved by removing the control bits and adding four new indirect registers per fsr depending on which indirect file register is being accessed it is possible to postdecrement , postincrement , or preincrement fsr ; or form the effective address by adding w to fsr ) instructions come in byte and ( 16-bit ) word forms stack is in ram ( with w15 as stack pointer ) ; there is no hardware stack w14 is the frame pointer data stored in rom may be accessed directly ( '' program space visibility '' ) vectored interrupts for different interrupt sources some features are : ( 16×16 ) -bit single-cycle multiplication and other digital signal processing operations hardware multiply–accumulate ( mac ) hardware divide assist ( 19 cycles for 32/16-bit divide ) barrel shifter - for both accumulators and general purpose registers bit reversal hardware support for loop indexing peripheral direct memory access dspics can be programmed in c using microchip 's xc16 compiler ( formerly called c30 ) which is a variant of gcc the first is like the classic pic instructions , with an operation between a specified f register ( i.e so the f operand may be any w register in november 2007 , microchip introduced the pic32mx family of 32-bit microcontrollers , based on the mips32 m4k core the first 18 models currently in production ( pic32mx3xx and pic32mx4xx ) are pin to pin compatible and share the same peripherals set with the pic24fxxga0xx family of ( 16-bit ) devices allowing the use of common libraries , software and hardware tools the pic32mz series include : 252 mhz core speed , 415 dmips up to 2 & nbsp ; mb flash and 512kb ram new peripherals including high-speed usb , crypto engine and sqi in 2015 , microchip released the pic32mz ef family , using the updated mips m5150 warrior m-class processor microchip introduced the pic32mk family in 2017 , specialized for motor control , industrial control , industrial internet of things ( iiot ) and multi-channel can applications is not encoded in the opcode ) all ram locations function as registers as both source and/or destination of math and other functions data space ( ram ) the addressability of memory varies depending on device series , and all pic devices have some bank switching to extend addressing to additional memory later series of devices feature move instructions , which can cover the whole addressable space , independent of the selected bank for example , pics in the baseline ( pic12 ) and mid-range ( pic16 ) families have program memory addressable in the same wordsize as the instruction width , i.e 12 or 14 bits respectively it is possible to skip skip instructions or the selected register ( e.g addwf reg , f ) the architectural decisions are directed at the maximization of speed-to-cost ratio many functions can be modeled in this way external interrupts have to be synchronized with the four-clock instruction cycle , otherwise there can be a one instruction cycle jitter small instruction set to learn risc architecture built-in oscillator with selectable speeds easy entry level , in-circuit programming plus in-circuit debugging pickit units available for less than 50 inexpensive microcontrollers wide range of interfaces including i²c , spi , usb , usart , a/d , programmable comparators , pwm , lin , can , psp , and ethernet availability of processors in dil package make them easy to handle for hobby use while several commercial compilers are available , in 2008 , microchip released their own c compilers , c18 and c30 , for the line of 18f 24f and 30/33f processors for example , the original parallax pic assembler ( '' spasm '' ) has macros , which hide w and make the pic look like a two-address machine keeloq rolling code encryption peripheral ( encode/decode ) and many more likewise , the original 12-bit instruction set of the pic1650 and its direct descendants has been superseded by 14-bit and 16-bit instruction sets microchip still sells otp ( one-time-programmable ) and windowed ( uv-erasable ) versions of some of its eprom based pics for legacy support or volume orders the microchip website lists pics that are not electrically erasable as otp an exception to this rule is the pic16c84 which uses eeprom and is therefore electrically erasable parts designed specifically for low voltage operation , within a strict range of 3 - 3.6 volts , are marked with a j in the part number microchip provides a freeware ide package called mplab , which includes an assembler , linker , software simulator , and debugger but for the free versions , optimizations will be disabled after 60 days several third parties develop c language compilers for pics , many of which integrate to mplab and/or feature their own ide demo boards are available with a small bootloader factory programmed that can be used to load user programs over an interface such as rs-232 or usb , thus obviating the need for a programmer device for example : the 12f690-icd will function as one of six different parts each of which features one , some or all of five on chip peripherals it is currently discontinued the 1886ve5u ( 1886ве5у ) through 1886ve7u ( 1886ве7у ) are specified for the military temperature range of -60 & nbsp ;
