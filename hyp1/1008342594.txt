a higher temperature of recorded at signy research station on 30 january 1982 was the record for the antarctic region encompassing all land and ice south of 60° s the altitude of the location is along the antarctic peninsula , temperatures as high as have been recorded , though the summer temperature is below most of the time the antarctic peninsula has the most moderate climate rainfall is rare and mainly occurs during the summer in coastal areas and surrounding islands if all the land-ice covering antarctica were to melt — around of ice — the seas would rise by over this would increase the amount of ice in antarctica , offsetting approximately one third of the expected sea level rise from thermal expansion of the oceans about 75 % of the coastline of antarctica is ice shelf ice shelves lose mass through breakup of glacial ice ( calving ) , or basal melting due to warm ocean water under the ice 2001 : of the larsen b ice shelf disintegrated in february 2001 the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of antarctica is positive – that is , the temperature is increasing – and significant at more than per decade since 1957 research published in 2009 found that overall the continent had become warmer since the 1950s , a finding consistent with the influence of man-made climate change a possible explanation is that loss of uv-absorbing ozone may have cooled the stratosphere and strengthened the polar vortex , a pattern of spinning winds around the south pole in their latest study ( 20 september 2007 ) nasa researchers have confirmed that antarctic snow is melting farther inland from the coast over time , melting at higher altitudes than ever and increasingly melting on antarctica 's largest ice shelf temperature data from the reader project a pamphlet about the weather and climate of antarctica antarctica 's central ice cap grows while glaciers melt antarctica climate and weather
