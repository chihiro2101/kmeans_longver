political and cultural impact ) outside the mainstream , too , reaction was slow the 1848 young ireland rebellion under thomas davis , though occurring at the start of the famine , was hardly impacted upon by the famine , as much as by the clash between the '' constitutional '' nationalism and catholicism of o'connell and the pluralist republicanism of davis though its electorate was a small part of the population ( as elsewhere in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ) , those irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1870s to vote for the two major british political parties , the conservatives and the liberals , with more votes and seats going to the latter , even though it had been the party of government during the famine 184 an additional social impact due to the high numbers of children orphaned was that for some young women , prostitution was one of few options available it is estimated that one and a half million people died during the famine and that a million emigrated between 1846 and 1851 the famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language ( the general exclusion of irish from public life and the influence of the english-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part ) but it was a conspicuous element in pre-famine ireland irish was the language both of a rich folk culture and a strong literary tradition the latter persisted

communities in the united states , remained emotionally attached to their native land it was no accident that the president of dáil éireann , éamon de valera in 1920 chose to travel to the united states , not elsewhere , in his efforts to get the irish republic recognised and accepted , or that when michael collins launched special bonds to fund the new republic , many were sold to irish americans lyons , john a all historians generally agree that british policies during the famine ( particularly those applied by the ministry of lord john russell ) were misguided , ill-informed , and counter-productive , and that had a similar crisis occurred in england instead of ireland then the government 's response would have been very different ireland commemorated the 150th anniversary of
