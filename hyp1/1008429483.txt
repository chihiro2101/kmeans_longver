his mother , who was much younger than his father , tutored him diligently throughout his early years , so he easily surpassed the other children at school '' he remained at the gymnasium for four years cuvier spent an additional four years at the caroline academy in stuttgart , where he excelled in all of his coursework cuvier 's german education exposed him to the work of the geologist abraham gottlob werner ( 1750 - 1817 ) , whose neptunism and emphasis on the importance of rigorous , direct observation of three-dimensional , structural relationships of rock formations to geological understanding provided models for cuvier 's scientific theories and methods upon graduation , he had no money on which to live as he awaited appointment to an academic office so in july 1788 , he took a job at fiquainville chateau in normandy as tutor to the only son of the comte d'héricy , a protestant noble n° 242 , june 2010 , issn 1161-9104 , p years later , in 1806 , he would return to the 'ohio animal ' in another paper and give it the name , '' mastodon '' he concluded this skeleton represented yet another extinct animal and , by comparing its skull with living species of tree-dwelling sloths , that it was a kind of ground-dwelling giant sloth in this latter capacity , he visited the south of france , but in the early part of 1803 , he was chosen permanent secretary of the department of physical sciences of the academy , and he consequently abandoned the earlier appointment and returned to paris in 1806 , he became a foreign member of the royal society , and in 1812 , a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1812 , cuvier made what the cryptozoologist bernard heuvelmans called his '' rash dictum '' : he remarked that it was unlikely that any large animal remained undiscovered andrew dickson white , a history of the warfare of science with theology in christendom appleton ( 1922 ) vol.1 p.64 cuvier was by birth , education , and conviction a devout lutheran , and remained protestant throughout his life while regularly attending church services . scientific ideas and their impact he studied the mummified cats and ibises that geoffroy had brought back from napoleon 's invasion of egypt , and showed they were no different from their living counterparts ; cuvier used this to support his claim that life forms did not evolve over time since a lesser time produced no organic changes , neither , he argued , would a much longer time de lamarck ( praise for m cuvier 's claim that new fossil forms appear abruptly in the geological record and then continue without alteration in overlying strata was used by later critics of evolution to support creationism , to whom the abruptness seemed consistent with special divine creation ( although cuvier 's finding that different types made their paleontological debuts in different geological strata clearly did not ) in his essay on the theory of the earth , he did say , '' no human bones have yet been found among fossil remains '' , but he made it clear exactly what he meant : '' when i assert that human bones have not been hitherto found among extraneous fossils , i must be understood to speak of fossils , or petrifactions , properly so called '' at the time cuvier presented his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , it was still widely believed that no species of animal had ever become extinct however , cuvier 's theory of extinction is still justified in the case of mass extinctions that occurred in the last 600 million years , when approximately half of all living species went completely extinct within a short geological span of two million years , due in part by volcanic eruptions , asteroids , and rapid fluctuations in sea level over the course of his career , cuvier came to believe there had not been a single catastrophe , but several , resulting in a succession of different faunas cuvier did n't wish to delve much into the causation of all the extinction and introduction of new animal species but rather focused on the sequential aspects of animal history on earth the 'preliminary discourse ' became very well known and , unauthorized translations were made into english , german , and italian ( and in the case of those in english , not entirely accurately ) in 1826 , cuvier would publish a revised version under the name , discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe ( discourse on the upheavals of the surface of the globe ) they published a preliminary version in 1808 and the final version was published in 1811 it was a major development in the history of paleontology and the history of geology the principle of correlation of parts was also cuvier 's way of understanding function in a non-evolutionary context , without invoking a divine creator see discussion in in the same 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in plaster quarries near paris , cuvier emphasizes the predictive power of his principle , writing , today comparative anatomy has reached such a point of perfection that , after inspecting a single bone , one can often determine the class , and sometimes even the genus of the animal to which it belonged , above all if that bone belonged to the head or the limbs comparative anatomy and classification at the paris museum , cuvier furthered his studies on the anatomical classification of animals he included these ideas in his 1817 book , le règne animal in 1798 , cuvier published his first independent work , the tableau élémentaire de l'histoire naturelle des animaux , which was an abridgment of his course of lectures at the école du pantheon and may be regarded as the foundation and first statement of his natural classification of the animal kingdom among living forms he published papers relating to the osteology of the rhinoceros indicus , the tapir , hyrax capensis , the hippopotamus , the sloths , the manatee , etc the department of palaeontology dealing with the mammalia may be said to have been essentially created and established by cuvier it appeared in four octavo volumes in 1817 ;
