rivers a similar treaty was made with the griqua chief adam kok iii the effect was to precipitate collisions between all three parties during their stay in natal the boers inflicted a severe defeat on the zulus under dingane in the battle of blood river in december 1838 , which , following on the flight of mzilikazi , greatly strengthened the position of moshoeshoe , whose power became a menace to that of the boer farmers this fact induced mr justice menzies , one of the judges of the cape colony then on circuit at colesberg , to cross the orange and proclaim the country british territory in october 1842 the proclamation was disallowed by the governor , sir george napier , who , nevertheless , maintained that the boer farmers remained british subjects shortly afterwards hostilities between the farmers and the griqua broke out the volksraad at winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the boers living between the orange and the vaal and was in federation with the volksraad at potchefstroom , which made a similar claim upon the great boers living north of the vaal in 1846 major warden occupied winburg for a short time , and the relations between the boers and the british were in a continual state of tension many of the farmers deserted winburg for the transvaal they were , however , defeated by sir harry smith in the battle of boomplaats on 29 august 1848 the british government ( under first russell ministry ) , which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country , had , however , already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the sovereignty at that time there were some 15,000 europeans in the country , many of them recent immigrants from cape colony there were among them numbers of farmers and tradesmen of british descent the majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of british rule provided that it was effective and the country guarded against its enemies '' and then , '' wrote george mccall theal , '' was seen forced the strange spectacle of an english commissioner addressing men who wished to be free of british control as the friendly and well-disposed inhabitants , while for those who desired to remain british subjects and who claimed that protection to which they believed themselves entitled he had no sympathising word five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in london with the colonial secretary , the duke of newcastle , who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of british rule executive authority was entrusted to a president elected by the burghers from a list submitted by the volksraad the constitution was subsequently modified but remained of a liberal character . conflict with the south african republic president boshoff not only got together some 800 men within the orange free state , but he received offers of support from commandant stephanus schoeman , the transvaal leader in the zoutpansberg district and from commandant joubert of lydenburg their force , too , only amounted to some three hundred the conduct of pretorius was stigmatised as '' blameworthy boshoff again tendered his resignation in february 1859 and retired to natal his election proved a turning-point in the history of the country , which , under his guidance , became peaceful and prosperous a treaty was signed at thaba bosiu in april 1866 , but war again broke out in 1867 , and the free state attracted to its side a large number of adventurers from all parts of south africa the intervention of the governor of cape colony led to the conclusion of the treaty of aliwal north ( 12 february 1869 ) , which defined the borders between the orange free state and basutoland in the years 1870â€“1871 a large number of foreign diggers had settled on the diamond fields near the junction of the vaal and orange rivers , which were situated in part on land claimed by the griqua chief nicholas waterboer and by the orange free state a paper currency had been instituted , and the notes , known as '' bluebacks '' , soon dropped to less than half their nominal value the diamond fields offered a ready market for stock and other agricultural produce money flowed into the pockets of the farmers public credit was restored . peaceful relations with neighbours he suggested that sir henry de villiers , chief justice of cape colony , should be sent into the transvaal to endeavour to gauge the true state of affairs in that country in 1888 sir johannes brand died the political treaty referred in general terms to a federal union between the south african republic and the orange free state , and bound each of them to help the other , whenever the independence of either should be assailed or threatened from without , unless the state so called upon for assistance should be able to show the injustice of the cause of quarrel in which the other state had engaged in the same year reitz retired from the presidency of the orange free state the 1896 presidential election to succeed him was won by m steyn , a judge of the high court , who took office in february 1896 the first census ,
