in 1879 , thomas edison baked cotton threads or bamboo slivers at high temperatures carbonizing them into an all-carbon fiber filament used in one of the first incandescent light bulbs to be heated by electricity in the early 1960s , a process was developed by dr akio shindo at agency of industrial science and technology of japan , using polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) as a raw material phillips , and w within a few years , after successful use in 1968 of a hyfil carbon-fiber fan assembly in the rolls-royce conway jet engines of the vickers vc10 , rolls-royce took advantage of the new material 's properties to break into the american market with its rb-211 aero-engine with carbon-fiber compressor blades also , during this period , the japanese government heavily supported carbon fiber development at home and several japanese companies such as toray , nippon carbon , toho rayon and mitsubishi started their own development and production in 1988 , dr t300 , hta and as4 ) had diameters of 16–22 micrometre later fibers ( e.g im6 or im600 ) have diameters that are approximately 5 micrometers the atomic structure of carbon fiber is similar to that of graphite , consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern ( graphene sheets ) , the difference being in the way these sheets interlock carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile are turbostratic , whereas carbon fibers derived from mesophase pitch are graphitic after heat treatment at temperatures exceeding 2200 & nbsp ; °c turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e , high stiffness or resistance to extension under load ) and high thermal conductivity in a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive industry , carbon fiber may be 10-12x more expensive passing current through the composite material 3d network of carbon fibers dissipates thermal energy that increases the surface temperature of the asphalt , which is able to melt ice and snow above it precursors for carbon fibers are polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) , rayon and pitch carbon fiber filament yarns are used in several processing techniques : the direct uses are for prepregging , filament winding , pultrusion , weaving , braiding , etc due to its chemical inertness , it can be used relatively safely amongst most fabrics and materials ; however , shorts caused by the material folding back on itself will lead to increased heat production and can lead to a fire
