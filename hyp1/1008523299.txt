research and development principles armadillo aerospace designed and built more than 12 vehicles which used about 50 engine designs for over 100 rocket flights each design had several features in common the company was a competitor for the ansari x-prize armadillo 's x-prize vehicle was unorthodox among modern rockets in that instead of using stabilization fins , which complicate the design and increase drag , armadillo used an aerodynamically unstable design , where the computer controlled jet vanes based on feedback from fibre optic gyroscopes armadillo aerospace competed in the 2006 x prize cup armadillo aerospace competed in the 2007 lunar lander challenge event in the wirefly x-prize cup 2007 the return leg was delayed slightly , because the igniter had clogged again as the vehicle was still flying , carmack flew the crippled vehicle through the course as quickly as possible and hovered 2–3 meters above the landing pad armadillo 's attempt at the level 2 prize on october 25 was aborted due to their vehicle toppling over after the engine casing burned through due to a fuel-line problem rocket racing , august 2008 , the rocket racing league was utilizing a highly modified velocity xl fg airframe and an armadillo aerospace 2,500 pound thrust liquid oxygen ( lox ) and ethanol rocket engine in both the mark-ii x-racer and mark-iii x-racer demonstration vehicles the third flight took place in january 2013 and the vehicle experienced a hard landing following a parachute failure-to-deploy , though the launch was good armadillo aerospace - news archive august 10 , 2010 the company mascot was an armadillo named widget in august 2013 , carmack indicated that following the crash of the stig-b rocket earlier that year , he had wound down the company operations and had put the company in '' hibernation mode during those two years , armadillo operated at an approximately us 1 million per year burn rate funded personally by carmack several reasons were offered for this outcome , including a failure to adopt a multi-test-vehicle build strategy , making the loss of a single rocket more significant than it would have otherwise been '' i have been corresponding with lutz for a few months now , and i have learned quite a few things i seriously considered an otrag style massive-cluster-of-cheap-modules orbital design back when we had 98 % peroxide ( assumed to be a biprop with kerosene ) , and i have always considered it one of the viable routes to significant reduction in orbital launch costs alt.space newspace list of private spaceflight companies blue origin space fellowship – hosts the official armadillo aerospace forum reusable vehicle testing – program of the japanese space agency jaxa commercial spaceflight federation blue origin new shepard
