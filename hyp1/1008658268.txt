the molecule is planar with an n-n bond distance of 1.78å and n-o distances of 1.19å in the first step , the ammonia is oxidized into nitric oxide : : 4 nh 3 + 5 o 2 → 4 no + 6 h 2 o most of the water is condensed out , and the gases are further cooled ; the nitric oxide that was produced is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide , which is then dimerized into nitrogen tetroxide : : 2 no + o 2 → 2 no 2 : 2 no 2 ⇌ n 2 o 4 and the remainder of the water is removed as nitric acid this synthesis is more practical in a laboratory setting and is commonly used as a demonstration or experiment in undergraduate chemistry labs in early 1944 , research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by german scientists , although the germans only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for s-stoff ( fuming nitric acid ) it is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel used on the u.s additionally , nto is often used with the addition of a small percentage of nitric oxide , which inhibits stress-corrosion cracking of titanium alloys , and in this form , propellant-grade nto is referred to as mixed oxides of nitrogen ( mon ) this was due to a switch accidentally left in the wrong position , which allowed the altitude control thrusters to fire after the cabin fresh air intake was opened , allowing nto fumes to enter the cabin 10 , 1975 sotos , john g . power generation using n 2 o 4 '' cool '' dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated , causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight
