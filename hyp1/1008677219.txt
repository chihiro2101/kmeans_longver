fluids may be administered as part of '' volume expansion '' , or fluid replacement , through the intravenous route crystalloids are aqueous solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules blood itself is considered a colloid lactated ringer 's ( also known as ringer 's lactate ) and the closely related ringer 's acetate , are mildly hypotonic solutions often used in those who have significant burns medications may be mixed into the fluids mentioned above , commonly normal saline , or dextrose solutions in atrial fibrillation , iv amiodarone may be administered to attempt to restore normal heart rhythm for some medications , there is virtually zero oral bioavailability in these cases , a medication may be given iv only until the patient can tolerate an oral form of the medication early blood transfusions consisted of whole blood , but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood , such as packed red blood cells , fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate parenteral nutrition is the act of providing required nutrients to a person through an intravenous line a person receiving parenteral nutrition will be given an intravenous solution which may contain salts , dextrose , amino acids , lipids and vitamins the utility of medical imaging relies on being able to clearly distinguish internal parts of the body from each other - one way this is accomplished is through the administration of a contrast agent into a vein players suspended after attending '' boutique iv clinics '' which offer this sort of treatment include footballer samir nasri in 2017 and swimmer ryan lochte in 2018 . use for hangover treatment the first '' boutique iv '' clinic , offering similar treatments , opened in tokyo in 2008 improperly administered intravenous glucose ( called '' ringer '' ) , such as that which is administered clandestinely in store-front clinics , poses increased risks due to improper technique and oversight some medications are able to be administered as a bolus dose , which is called an '' iv push '' certain medications , such as potassium , are not able to be administered by iv push due to the extremely rapid onset of action and high level of effects an infusion of medication may be used when it is desirable to have a constant blood concentration of a medication over time , such as with some antibiotics including beta-lactams continuous infusions , where the next infusion is begun immediately following the completion of the prior , may also be used to limit variation in drug concentration in the blood ( i.e between the peak drug levels and the trough drug levels ) they may also be used instead of intermittent bolus injections for the same reason , such as with furosemide alternatively , the needle may be placed and then connected to a length of tubing , allowing for an infusion to be administered the most common sizes are 16-gauge ( midsize line used for blood donation and transfusion ) , 18- and 20-gauge ( all-purpose line for infusions and blood draws ) , and 22-gauge ( all-purpose pediatric line ) the trocar is then withdrawn and discarded . peripherally inserted central catheter a peripherally inserted central catheter ( also called a picc line ) is a type of central iv access which consists of a cannula is inserted through a sheath into a peripheral vein and then carefully fed towards the heart , terminating at the superior vena cava or the right atrium some iv lines may be placed with '' y-sites '' , devices which enable a secondary solution to be administered through the same line ( known as piggybacking ) a pump is programmed based on the number and size of infusions being administered to ensure all medicine is fully administered without allowing the access line to run dry if the cannula is not inserted correctly , or the vein is particularly fragile and ruptures , blood may extravasate into the surrounding tissues , this situation is known as a blown vein or '' tissuing '' however , pathogens may also enter the bloodstream , causing an infection called sepsis which can be sudden and life-threatening however , recent studies have found that there is no increased risk of complications in those whose ivs were replaced only when clinically indicated versus those whose ivs were replaced routinely phlebitis is particularly common in intravenous drug users , and those undergoing chemotherapy , whose veins can become sclerotic and difficult to access over time , sometimes forming a hard , painful “ venous cord ” infiltration occurs when a non-vesicant iv fluid or medication enters the surrounding tissue as opposed to the desired vein if the solutions administered are colder than the temperature of the body , induced hypothermia can occur one of the leading medical history textbooks for medical and nursing students has claimed that the entire story was an anti-semitic fabrication intravenous therapy was expanded by italian physician guido baccelli in the late 1890s see , for example , the nobel prize nomination database : and further developed in the 1930s by samuel hirschfeld , harold t
