bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity the apparently constant surveillance of the prison inmates by the panopticon manager and the occasional observation of the manager by the general public was to solve the age old philosophic question : '' who guards the guards ? '' bentham continued to develop the panopticon concept , as industrialisation advanced in england and an increasing number of workers were required to work in ever larger factories bentham commissioned drawings from an architect , willey reveley shortly after jeremy bentham 's death in 1832 his ideas were criticised by augustus pugin , who in 1841 published the second edition of his work contrasts in which one plate showed a '' modern poor house '' in the late 1960s , the american historian gertrude himmelfarb , who had published the haunted house of jeremy bentham in 1965 , was at the forefront of depicting bentham 's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control he argued that the disciplinary society had emerged in the 18th century and that discipline are techniques for assuring the ordering of human complexities , with the ultimate aim of docility and utility in the system the french sociologist henri lefebvre studied urban space and foucault 's interpretation of the panopticon prison , arriving at the conclusion that spatiality is a social phenomenon with regards to the panopticon , deleuze argued that '' enclosures are moulds but controls are a modulation '' with reference to the big brother television shows of endemol entertainment , in which a group of people live in a container studio apartment and allow themselves to be recorded constantly , weibel argued that the panopticon provides the masses with '' the pleasure of power , the pleasure of sadism , voyeurism , exhibitionism , scopophilia , and narcissism '' in 2006 , shoreditch tv became available to residents of the shoreditch in london , so that they could tune in to watch cctv footage live particular attention has been drawn to the similarities of cctv with bentham 's prison design because cctv technology enabled , in effect , a central observation tower , staffed by an unseen observer in 1981 the sociologist anthony giddens expressed scepticism about the ongoing surveillance debate , criticising that '' foucault 's 'archaeology ' , in which human beings do not make their own history but are swept along by it , does not adequately acknowledge that those subject to the power & nbsp ; fordism , taylorism and bureaucratic management of factories was still assumed to reflect a mature industrial society time-theft by workers has become accepted as an output restriction and theft has been associated by management with all behaviour that include avoidance of work because the controlled is at the center and surrounded by those who watch , early surveillance studies treat social media as a reverse panopticon therefore , he argues that the relationship between the large number of users and the sociotechnical web 2.0 platform , like facebook , amounts to a panopticon . the arts and literature according to professor donald preziosi , the panopticon prison of bentham resonates with the memory theatre of giulio camillo , where the sitting observer is at the centre and the phenomena are categorised in an array , which makes comparison , distinction , contrast and variation legible at the center of the rotunda beneath the dome was an elevated platform from which a 360 degrees panorama could be viewed , illuminated through skylights in 1854 the work on the building that was to house the royal panopticon of science and art in london was completed the rotunda at the centre of the building was encircled with a 91 meter procession foucault 's theories positioned bentham 's panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s europe this led to the widespread use of the panopticon in literature , comic books , computer games , and tv series
