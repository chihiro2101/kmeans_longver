huygens separated from cassini orbiter at 02:00 utc on december 25 , 2004 in spacecraft event time the six instruments are : huygens atmospheric structure instrument ( hasi ) on the surface of titan , the electrical conductivity and permittivity ( i.e the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects measurements started above titan 's surface , where huygens was blown eastwards at more than , agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at altitude , made over the past few years using telescopes solar aureole cameras measured how scattering by aerosols varies the intensity directly around the sun all measurements were timed by aid of a shadow bar , which would tell disr when the sun had passed through the field of view '' m g tomasko ; d buchhauser ; m bushroe ; l e dafoe ; l r doose ; a eibl ; c fellows ; e m farlane ; g m prout ; m j pringle the mass spectrometer , a high-voltage quadrupole , collected data to build a model of the molecular masses of each gas , and a more powerful separation of molecular and isotopic species was accomplished by the gas chromatograph , samples altered by heating ) passed to it from the aerosol collector pyrolyser the acp was developed by a ( french ) esa team at the laboratoire inter-universitaire des systèmes atmosphériques ( lisa ) the ssp contained a number of sensors designed to determine the physical properties of titan 's surface at the point of impact , whether the surface was solid or liquid if the surface had been liquid , other sensors would also have measured its density , temperature , thermal conductivity , heat capacity , electrical properties ( permittivity and conductivity ) and refractive index ( using a critical angle refractometer ) a penetrometer instrument , that protruded past the bottom of the huygens descent module , was used to create a penetrometer trace as huygens landed on the surface the huygens ssp was developed by the space sciences department of the university of kent and the rutherford appleton laboratory space science department under the direction of professor john zarnecki the ssp research and responsibility transferred to the open university when john zarnecki transferred in 2000 ( offline as of 2006-10-14 , see internet archive version ) how huygens avoided disaster , james oberg , the space review , january 17 , 2005 since huygens was too small to transmit directly to earth , it was designed to transmit the telemetry data obtained while descending through titan 's atmosphere to cassini by radio , which would in turn relay it to earth using its large diameter main antenna the trajectory change overcame the design flaw for the most part , and data transmission succeeded , although the information from one of the two radio channels was lost due to an unrelated error esa announced that the error was a mistake on their part , the missing command was part of a command sequence developed by esa for the huygens mission , and that it was executed by cassini as delivered
