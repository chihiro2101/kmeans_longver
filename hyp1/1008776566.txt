at the start of the second punic war , masinissa fought for carthage against syphax , the king of the masaesyli of western numidia ( present day algeria ) , who had allied himself with the romans having lost the alliance with masinissa , hasdrubal started to look for another ally , which he found in syphax , who married sophonisba , hasdrubal 's daughter , who until the defection had been betrothed to masinissa this decided the battle and at once hannibal 's army began to collapse masinissa was now king of both the massylii and the masaesyli any hopes he may have had of extending his rule right across north africa were dashed , however , when a roman commission headed by the elderly cato the elder ( cato the elder ) came to africa about 155 bc to decide a territorial dispute between masinissa and carthage animated probably by an irrational fear of a carthaginian revival , but possibly by suspicion of masinissa â€™ s ambitions , cato thenceforward advocated , finally with success , the destruction of carthage jpg central wall depicting sophonisba requesting help from massinissa file : giovanni battista tiepolo - scipio africanus freeing massiva - google art project.jpg scipio the african freeing massiva list of kings of numidia the war with hannibal new york : penguin classics
