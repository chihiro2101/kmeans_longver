in the offshore magnetic data , penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated , and mapped when i laid it next to my no 2 pencil mapping of the offshore magnetic anomalies , the fit was perfect : a shallow , 180-kilometer diameter gravity-magnetic bullseye on the almost non-magnetic , uniform carbonate background of the yucatan platform ! we recognized the crater as the likely cretaceous-paleogene boundary event image : chicxulub shockedquartz.png thumb penfield with the sample of shocked quartz found at well 2 , chicxulub pemex disallowed release of specific data but let penfield and company official antonio camargo present their results at the 1981 society of exploration geophysicists conference in 1981 , unaware of penfield 's discovery , university of arizona graduate student alan r hildebrand interview : 'similar deposits of rubble occur all across the southern coast of north america … indicate that something extraordinary happened here the impact created a hole wide and deep , leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by of sediment by the 21st century '' on the ground , you would feel an effect similar to an oven on broil , lasting for about an hour pope , ocampo , et al a model of the event developed by lomax et al in february 2008 , a team of researchers led by sean gulick at the university of texas at austin 's jackson school of geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than previously assumed '' this was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate-containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring ( the rocks found were from deep within the earth 's crust instead ) , the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere hildebrand , penfield , et al below these layers lie more than of andesite glass and breccia kring , '' discovering the crater '' bottke , vokrouhlicky , nesvorny in february 2021 , scientists reported studies suggesting the impactor that led to the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was a fragment from a disrupted comet , rather than an asteroid which has long been the leading candidate among scientists . chicxulub and mass extinction the chicxulub crater lends support to the theory postulated by the late physicist luis alvarez and his son , geologist walter alvarez , that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups , including non-avian dinosaurs , may have resulted from a bolide impact ( the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event ) it coincides with the k–pg boundary , the geological boundary between the cretaceous and paleogene this conclusion is unsupported by radioactive dating and sedimentology a more recent discovery is believed to demonstrate evidence of the scope of the destruction from the impact mullen , '' shiva '' the collision of comet shoemaker–levy 9 with jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet , giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet macleod conducted his analysis approximately from the chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site , while still close enough to be affected by the impact chicxulub and the exploration of large peak-ring impact craters through scientific drilling ( pdf ) kring , philippe claeys , sean p.s gulick , joanna v morgan , and gareth s the geological society of america it had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes ; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant , since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits , originating much deeper in the earth , and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact this global dispersal of dust and sulfates would have led to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide , large temperature drops , and devastated the food chain the researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life , but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life ( pdf ) barry j
