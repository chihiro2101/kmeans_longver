mercer county reservoir ) in ohio around 1896 , the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california in 1946 , magnolia petroleum ( now exxonmobil ) drilled at a site off the coast , erecting a platform in of water off st mary parish , louisiana but it was kerr-mcgee oil industries ( now part of occidental petroleum ) , as operator for partners phillips petroleum ( conocophillips ) and stanolind oil & gas ( bp ) , that completed its historic ship shoal block 32 well in october 1947 , months before superior actually drilled a discovery from their vermilion platform farther offshore it was designed by r it was lost in 1969 notable offshore fields include : the north sea the gulf of mexico ( offshore texas , louisiana , mississippi , alabama and florida ) california ( in the los angeles basin and santa barbara channel , part of the ventura basin ) the caspian sea ( notably some major fields offshore azerbaijan ) the campos and santos basins off the coasts of brazil newfoundland and nova scotia ( atlantic canada ) several fields off west africa most notably west of nigeria and angola offshore fields in south east asia and sakhalin , russia major offshore oil fields are located in the persian gulf such as safaniya , manifa and marjan which belong to saudi arabia and are developed by saudi aramco jack-up mobile drilling units ( or jack-ups ) , as the name suggests , are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered , much like jacks some variants of these applications , called floating storage and offloading unit or fsu ( floating storage unit ) , are used exclusively for storage purposes , and host very little process equipment the world 's first flng facility is currently under development see the section on particularly large examples below tlps are floating platforms tethered to the seabed in a manner that eliminates most vertical movement of the structure tlps are used in water depths up to about mini tlps can also be used as utility , satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries it is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard , by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow , and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water the jacks shall be released gradually whilst the gbs is ballasted to ensure that the gbs does not sway too much from target location spars have to-date been designed in three configurations : the '' conventional '' one-piece cylindrical hull ; the '' truss spar '' , in which the midsection is composed of truss elements connecting the upper buoyant hull ( called a hard tank ) with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast ; and the '' cell spar '' , which is built from multiple vertical cylinders the world 's deepest platform as of 2011 was the perdido spar in the gulf of mexico , floating in 2,438 metres of water these installations , sometimes called toadstools , are small platforms , consisting of little more than a well bay , helipad and emergency shelter larger platforms assisted by smaller esvs ( emergency support vessels ) like the british iolair that are summoned when something has gone wrong , e.g when a search and rescue operation is required on smaller platforms , one worker can perform a number of different jobs the following also are not names officially recognized in the industry : oim ( offshore installation manager ) who is the ultimate authority during his/her shift and makes the essential decisions regarding the operation of the platform ; operations team leader ( otl ) ; offshore methods engineer ( ome ) who defines the installation methodology of the platform ; offshore operations engineer ( ooe ) who is the senior technical authority on the platform ; pstl or operations coordinator for managing crew changes ; dynamic positioning operator , navigation , ship or vessel maneuvering ( modu ) , station keeping , fire and gas systems operations in the event of incident ; automation systems specialist , to configure , maintain and troubleshoot the process control systems ( pcs ) , process safety systems , emergency support systems and vessel management systems ; second mate to meet manning requirements of flag state , operates fast rescue craft , cargo operations , fire team leader ; third mate to meet manning requirements of flag state , operate fast rescue craft , cargo operations , fire team leader ; ballast control operator to operate fire and gas systems ; crane operators to operate the cranes for lifting cargo around the platform and between boats ; scaffolders to rig up scaffolding for when it is required for workers to work at height ; coxswains to maintain the lifeboats and manning them if necessary ; control room operators , especially fpso or production platforms ; catering crew , including people tasked with performing essential functions such as cooking , laundry and cleaning the accommodation ; production techs to run the production plant ; helicopter pilot ( s ) living on some platforms that have a helicopter based offshore and transporting workers to other platforms or to shore on crew changes ; maintenance technicians ( instrument , electrical or mechanical ) radio operator to operate all radio communications the report was commissioned in 1988 , and was delivered november 1990 on april 21 , 2010 , the deepwater horizon platform , 52 miles off-shore of venice , louisiana , ( property of transocean and leased to bp ) exploded , killing 11 people , and sank two days later the united states and brunei have active rigs-to-reefs programs , in which former oil platforms are left in the sea , either in place or towed to new locations , as permanent artificial reefs . effects on the environment to reduce the amount of carbon emissions otherwise released into the atmosphere , methane pyrolysis of natural gas pumped up by oil platforms can be performed old oil rigs could become co2 storage sites ageing oil rigs could be used to store carbon and fight climate change others have been sea launch launches , and more are being redesigned for use with heavy-lift launch vehicles production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment , such as the troll a platform standing on a depth of 300 meters while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform , the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities one such challenge in shallower environments is seabed gouging by ice ( means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed ) these efforts among others are contained in the established term integrated operations list of tallest oil platforms accommodation platform chukchi cap conductor support system deep sea mining deepwater drilling drillship north sea oil offshore geotechnical engineering offshore oil and gas in the united states oil drilling protocol for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of fixed platforms located on the continental shelf sar201 shallow water drilling submarine pipeline tempsc texas towers
