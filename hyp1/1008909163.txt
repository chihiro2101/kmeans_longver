his brother , david m he held postdoctoral research positions at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara and the university of chicago , before becoming a faculty member at yale , syracuse and pennsylvania state universities lqg is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theory , which allows the use of techniques from particle physics , particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops these include very high energy cosmic rays and photons and neutrinos from gamma ray bursts among smolin 's contributions are the coinvention of doubly special relativity ( with joão magueijo , independently of work by giovanni amelino-camelia ) and of relative locality ( with amelino-camelia , laurent freidel and jerzy kowalski-glikman ) contributions to the philosophy of physics as a case study , the trouble with physics focused on the issue of the falsifiability of string theory due to the proposals that the anthropic principle be used to explain the properties of our universe in the context of the string landscape finally , the trouble with physics is also broadly concerned with the role of controversy and the value of diverse approaches in the ethics and process of science it is not enough to combine them i believe this because i have never encountered an interpretation of the present formulation of quantum mechanics that makes sense to me neither other universes nor copies of our universe—within or outside—exist no copies can exist within the universe , because no subsystem can model precisely the larger system it is a part of a reason for asserting it , is that anything that existed for just one moment , without causing or implying some aspect of the world at a future moment , would be gone in the next moment '' introduction '' to kauffman , stuart and smolin , lee in 2014 he was awarded the buchalter cosmology prize for a work published in collaboration with marina cortês marina cortês , dr smolin was born in new york city smolin is married to dina graser , a lawyer and urban policy consultant in toronto , ontario his brother is law professor david m a partial list of smolin 's published work a debate of the merits of string theory between smolin and brian greene , from national public radio ( 2006 ) '' the unique universe '' : smolin explains his skepticism re the multiverse ( 2009 ) closer to the truth : series of interviews by smolin on fundamental issues in physics : smolin 's presentation at the royal society of arts ( 2013 )
