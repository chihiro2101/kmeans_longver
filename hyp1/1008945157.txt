before the introduction of digital printing technology , production of small numbers of publications had many limitations and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer , but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable there is little or no waste from unsold products for example , uk art retailer king and mcgaw fulfills many of its art print orders by printing on-demand rather than pre-printing and storing them until they are sold , requiring less space and reducing overheads to the business this was brought about after a fire destroyed Â£3 million worth of stock and damage to their warehouse there are three main categories of offerings the initial investment required for pod services is less than for offset printing the major photo storage services ( e.g eastman kodak 's ofoto and shutterfly and hewlett-packard 's snapfish ) have included the ability to produce picture books and calendars print-on-demand services that offer printing and distributing services to publishing companies ( instead of directly to self-publishing authors ) are also growing in popularity within the industry among traditional publishers , pod services can be used to make sure that books remain available when one print job has sold out , but another has not yet become available print on demand can be used to reduce risk when dealing with '' surge '' publications that are expected to have large sales but a brief sales life ( such as biographies of minor celebrities , or event tie-ins ) : these publications represent good profitability but also great risk owing to the danger of inadvertently printing many more copies than are necessary , and the associated costs of maintaining excess inventory or pulping pod service is not always easy to implement print on demand also allows books to be printed in a variety of formats because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs however , wholesalers monitor what works they are selling , and if authors promote their work successfully and achieve a reasonable number of orders from book stores or online retailers ( who use the same wholesalers as the stores ) , then there is a reasonable chance of their work becoming available on such terms
