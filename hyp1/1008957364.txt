the descendants of these colonies have since spread throughout the americas , moving through the amazon basin in the 1970s , crossing into central america in 1982 , and reaching mexico in 1985 were discovered in 1985 at an oil field in the san joaquin valley of california live in dramatically higher population densities africanized honey bees are considered an invasive species in the americas their expansion stopped for a time at eastern texas , possibly due to the large population of european honey bee hives in the area in october & nbsp ; 2010 , a 73-year-old man was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees while clearing brush on his south georgia property , as determined by georgia 's department of agriculture in 2012 , tennessee state officials reported that a colony was found for the first time in a beekeeper 's colony in monroe county in the eastern part of the state the hive was subsequently destroyed there were discussions about slowing the spread by placing large numbers of docile european-strain hives in strategic locations , particularly at the isthmus of panama , but various national and international agricultural departments could not prevent the bees ' expansion there are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either africanized honey bees dominate , a mix of africanized and european honey bees is present , or only non-africanized honey bees are found , as in the southern portions of south america or northern north america the reduced available winter forage in northern california means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup the arrival of the africanized honey bee in central america is threatening the ancient art of keeping melipona stingless bees in log gums , although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other a study comparing a for example , european honey bees ( apis mellifera ligustica ) forage at older ages and harvest less pollen and more concentrated nectar selection in natural populations of honey bees show that positive selection of sensitivity to low concentrations of sucrose are linked to foraging at younger ages and collecting resources low in sucrose natural selection is able to directly shift the set of foraging behaviors by operating on the distribution of these genes in the honey bee population ( pankiw , 2003 ) the popular term '' killer bee '' has only limited scientific meaning today because there is no generally accepted fraction of genetic contribution used to establish a cut-off , has the same morphology molecular diagnostics using the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) cytochrome b gene can differentiate a scutellata from other a as of the early 1600s , it was introduced to north america , with subsequent introductions of other european subspecies 200 years later the subspecies are grouped and listed according to the scientists who analyzed its genetic code , the western honey bee originated in africa and spread to eurasia in two ancient migrations the matrilineal descendants are in the vast majority population genetics analysis of africanized honey bees in the united states , using a maternally inherited genetic marker , found 12 & nbsp ; distinct mitotypes , and the amount of genetic variation observed supports the idea that there have been multiple introductions of ahb into the united states these observations are largely driven by one large gene‚Äêrich 1.4 & nbsp ; mbp segment on chromosome 11 where european haplotypes are present at a significantly elevated frequency and likely confer an adaptive advantage in the africanized honey bee population it is also becoming apparent that africanized honey bees have another advantage over european honey bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues , including parasites such as varroa destructor , some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers not all africanized honey bee hives display the typical hyper-defensive behavior , which may provide bee breeders a point to begin breeding a gentler stock ( gahbs ) less is known than is known about dogs as victims there is a widespread consensus that cattle are suffering occasional ahb attacks in brazil , but little documentation
