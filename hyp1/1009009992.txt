what is a pattern ? guiding patterns of naturally occurring design : elements in pattern languages for design , the parts break down in this way : the language description – the vocabulary – is a collection of named , described solutions to problems in a field of interest for example , rooms have ways to get light , and ways to get people in and out at this point , the design almost always becomes a better design so , alexander famously advocated on-site improvisation by concerned , empowered users , alexander , christopher , the oregon project as a powerful way to form very workable large-scale initial solutions , maximizing the utility of a design , and minimizing the design rework an important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system ( that may be a house , a computer program or an object of daily use ) , and to assist in the design of future systems for instance , alexander 's pattern '' a place to wait '' addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery , while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions for instance , there could be a pattern suggesting a wireless telephone generic structure and layout aggregation in an associative network ( pattern language ) in alexander 's book , such links are collected in the '' references '' part , and echoed in the linked pattern 's '' context '' part – thus the overall structure is a directed graph even without the pattern description , these links , along with meaningful names , carry a message : when building a place outside where people can spend time ( '' public outdoor room '' ) , consider to surround it by stairs where people can sit ( '' stair seats '' ) some authors , however , like gamma et al in such a case we would speak of a pattern catalogue rather than a pattern language for additional discussion of motivation and rationale as well as examples and experiments , see : alexander 's specifications for using pattern languages as well as creating new ones remain influential , and his books are referenced for style by experts in unrelated fields name : chocolatechipratio context : you are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends consider these patterns first : sugarratio , flourratio , eggratio problem : determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough solution : observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the chocolate chip cookie consider next : nutratio or cookingtime or freezingmethod he used it to refer to common problems of the design and construction of buildings and towns and how they should be solved the following definitions of '' pattern '' and '' pattern language '' are paraphrased from a pattern language : '' a pattern is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context , describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice examples since the 1990s include software design patterns in software engineering and , more generally , architectural pattern ( computer science ) , as well as interaction design patterns feng shui method engineering modular design modularity complementary architecture rule of thumb shearing layers systems theory typology ( urban planning and architecture ) christopher alexander , sara ishikawa , murray silverstein ( 1974 ) architects year book 14 , elek , london the timeless way of building usa : oxford university press liberating voices : a pattern language for communication revolution usa : mit press about patterns in general a pattern language for pattern writing by gerard meszaros and jim doble use of patterns for scenario development for large scale aerospace projects lean startup business model pattern what is a quality use case ? from the book patterns for effective use cases
