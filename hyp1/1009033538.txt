although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure , as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility , studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality beta-blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion , which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering the extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood food and drug administration beta-blockers are inexpensive , said to be relatively safe , and on one hand , seem to improve musicians ' performances on a technical level , while some , such as barry green , the author of '' the inner game of music '' and don greene , a former olympic diving coach who teaches juilliard students to overcome their stage fright naturally , say the performances may be perceived as '' soulless and inauthentic '' in the 2008 summer olympics , 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist kim jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals adverse drug reactions associated with the use of beta blockers include : nausea , diarrhea , bronchospasm , dyspnea , cold extremities , exacerbation of raynaud 's syndrome , bradycardia , hypotension , heart failure , heart block , fatigue , dizziness , alopecia ( hair loss ) , abnormal vision , hallucinations , insomnia , nightmares , sexual dysfunction , erectile dysfunction and/or alteration of glucose and lipid metabolism due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier , lipophilic beta blockers , such as propranolol and metoprolol , are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances , such as insomnia , vivid dreams and nightmares this causes hyponatremia and hyperkalemia β1-blockers have fewer metabolic side effects in diabetic patients ; however , the fast heart rate that serves as a warning sign for insulin-induced low blood sugar may be masked , resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness the phenomenon of '' unopposed alpha stimulation '' has not been reported with the use of beta blockers for treatment of methamphetamine toxicity other appropriate antihypertensive drugs to administer during hypertensive crisis resulting from stimulant overdose are vasodilators such as nitroglycerin , diuretics such as furosemide , and alpha blockers such as phentolamine abrupt withdrawal can result in a thyroid storm . bradycardia or av block stimulation of β 1 receptors by epinephrine and norepinephrine induces a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect on the heart and increases cardiac conduction velocity and automaticity since β 2 adrenergic receptors can cause vascular smooth muscle dilation , beta blockers may cause some vasoconstriction also referred to as intrinsic sympathomimetic effect , this term is used particularly with beta-blockers that can show both agonism and antagonism at a given beta receptor , depending on the concentration of the agent ( beta-blocker ) and the concentration of the antagonized agent ( usually an endogenous compound , such as norepinephrine ) some beta blockers ( e.g . α 1 -receptor antagonism β 1 -selective beta blockers are also known as cardioselective beta blockers β 3 -selective agents agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic action ( isa ) acebutolol , pindolol , labetalol , mepindolol , oxprenolol , celiprolol , penbutolol agents organized by lipid solubility ( lipophilicity ) high lipophilicity : propranolol , labetalol intermediate lipophilicity : metoprolol , bisoprolol , carvedilol , acebutolol , timolol , pindolol low lipophilicity ( also known as hydrophilic beta-blockers ) : atenolol , nadolol , and sotalol agents with membrane stabilizing effect carvedilol , propranolol > oxprenolol > labetalol , metoprolol , timolol however , other studies do not show a correlation between cancer survival and beta blocker usage '' chapter 3 , schizoid personality disorder ''
