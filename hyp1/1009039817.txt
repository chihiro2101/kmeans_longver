the new westinghouse brakes were explained to the railroad workers in many books thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes westinghouse soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action , these three components became the piston valve , the slide valve , and the graduating valve when the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve , the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate , reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder the subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge the contents of the brake cylinder to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs in fact , modern locomotives employ two air brake systems the independent brake is a '' straight air '' system that makes brake applications on the head-of-train locomotive consist independently of the automatic brake , providing for more nuanced train control the triple valve is divided into two portions : the service section , which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions , and the emergency section , which senses the faster emergency reduction of train line pressure use of distributed power ( i.e the brakes are applied when the engineer moves the automatic brake handle to a '' service '' position , which causes a reduction in brake pipe pressure during normal service , the pressure in the brake pipe is never reduced to zero and in fact , the smallest reduction that will cause a satisfactory brake response is used to conserve brake pipe pressure ep brakes have been in british practice since 1949 and also used in german high-speed trains ( most notably the ice ) since the late 1980s ; they are fully described in electro-pneumatic brake system on british railway trains this controller compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self lapping portion of the engineers valve , signaling all of the '' apply '' or '' release '' magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously , changing the pressure in the '' straight air '' trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment on a descending grade , the result will be a runaway the triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction however , if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications , an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves , leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train in addition to the traditional brake pipe , this enhancement adds the main reservoir pipe , which is continuously charged with air directly from the locomotive 's main reservoir there are a number of safeguards that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident happening european railway air brakes include the kunze-knorr brake ( invented by georg knorr and manufactured by knorr-bremse ) and the oerlikon some locomotives , e.g on the london , brighton and south coast railway , were dual-fitted so that they could work with either vacuum- or air-braked trains file : kkg zeichnung.jpg kunze-knorr goods train brake ( diagram ) file : freno oerlikon.jpg oerlikon brake valve file:151 012 čd brake controller and brake valve.jpg čd brake controller and brake valve ( czech republic ) file:100 1463 ( small ) jpg london , brighton and south coast railway locomotive in a positive air system , a leak is quickly found due to the escaping pressurized air ; discovering a vacuum leak is more difficult , although it is easier to repair when found because a piece of rubber ( for example ) can just be tied around the leak and will be firmly held there by the vacuum despite requiring larger and heavier equipment as stated above , the performance of the electro-vacuum brake approached that of contemporary electro-pneumatic brakes however , their use has not been repeated .
