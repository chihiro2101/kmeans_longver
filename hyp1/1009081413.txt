the name '' paramecium '' – constructed from the greek ( paramēkēs , '' oblong '' ) – was coined in 1752 by the english microscopist john hill , who applied the name generally to '' animalcules which have no visible limbs or tails , and are of an irregularly oblong figure '' the body of the cell is enclosed by a stiff but elastic structure called the pellicle this is lined with inconspicuous cilia which beat continuously , drawing food inside the cell paramecia live mainly by heterotrophy , feeding on bacteria and other small organisms the beat of each cilium has two phases : a fast '' effective stroke '' , during which the cilium is relatively stiff , followed by a slow '' recovery stroke '' , during which the cilium curls loosely to one side and sweeps forward in a counter-clockwise fashion the food passes from the cilia-lined oral groove into a narrower structure known as the buccal cavity ( gullet ) within five minutes of a vacuole 's formation , ph of its contents drops from 7 to 3 when the vacuole , with its fully digested contents , reaches the anal pore , it ruptures , expelling its waste contents to the environment , outside the cell paramecium bursaria and paramecium chlorelligerum harbour endosymbiotic green algae , from which they derive nutrients and a degree of protection from predators such as didinium nasutum the genome of the species paramecium tetraurelia has been sequenced , providing evidence for three whole-genome duplications however , another study in 2017 suggested that the paramecia can only learn to associate the bright side of its swimming medium to electric current and not the dark side . reproduction and sexual phenomena under certain conditions , it may be preceded by self-fertilization ( autogamy ) , or it may follow isogamy , a sexual phenomenon in which paramecium of compatible mating types fuse temporarily and exchange genetic material the gametes of each organism then fuse to form diploid micronuclei in some species , such as the well studied paramecium tetraurelia , the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo autogamy or conjugation when clonally aged p during either of these processes , the micronuclei of the cell ( s ) undergo meiosis , the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear dna that had recently undergone meiosis
