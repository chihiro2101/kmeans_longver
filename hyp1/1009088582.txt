hydrogen sulfide is slightly soluble in water and acts as a weak acid ( pk a & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6.9 in 0.01–0.1 & nbsp ; mol/litre solutions at 18 & nbsp ; °c ) , giving the hydrosulfide ion ( also written the sulfide anion is not formed in aqueous solution sulfur-reducing ) bacteria generate usable energy under low-oxygen conditions by using sulfates ( resp . biosynthesis in the body dietary amino acids , such as methionine and cysteine serve as the primary substrates for the transulfuration pathways and in the production of hydrogen sulfide according to a current classification , pathophysiological states with h 2 s overproduction ( e.g although the understanding of h 2 s biology has significantly advanced over the last decade , many questions remain , for instance related to the quantification of endogenous h 2 s levels production of sulfur , thioorganic compounds , and alkali metal sulfides specifically , salts of sh − break bonds between lignin and cellulose components of pulp in the kraft process this conversion is widely exploited metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen sulfide when the cell is stressed with disease , enzymes are drawn into the cell to produce small amounts of hydrogen sulfide this study could have further implications on preventing strokes , heart disease and arthritis ms + → mo + these bacteria can not survive in air but the moist , warm , anaerobic conditions of buried waste that contains a high source of carbon & ndash ; in inert landfills , paper and glue used in the fabrication of products such as drywall can provide a rich source of carbon & ndash ; is an excellent environment for the formation of hydrogen sulfide removal from fuel gases hydrogen sulfide generated in this process is typically converted to elemental sulfur using the claus process hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas ( flammable range : 4.3–46 % ) hydrogen sulfide is a broad-spectrum poison , meaning that it can poison several different systems in the body , although the nervous system is most affected the toxicity of is comparable with that of carbon monoxide it binds with iron in the mitochondrial cytochrome enzymes , thus preventing cellular respiration exposure to lower concentrations can result in eye irritation , a sore throat and cough , nausea , shortness of breath , and fluid in the lungs ( pulmonary edema ) short-term , high-level exposure can induce immediate collapse , with loss of breathing and a high probability of death 20 & nbsp ; ppm is the osha permissible exposure limit ( 8 hour time-weighted average ) 10 ppm is the rel ( recommended exposure limit ) set by niosh , the us national institute for occupational safety and health 50–100 & nbsp ; ppm leads to eye damage at 100–150 & nbsp ; ppm the olfactory nerve is paralyzed after a few inhalations , and the sense of smell disappears , often together with awareness of danger a person may die from the second inhalation of the gas , and a warning itself may be too late as a result , all such compartments are now required to have a ventilation system after investigation it was determined that the large amount of gas originated from imperfect treatment and disposal of waste water in the building residents living in the area were urged to stay indoors by the emergencies ministry a report from the orange-osceola medical examiner 's office indicated that toxic fumes came from the porsche 's starter battery , located under the front passenger seat microbial : the sulfur cycle in the absence of oxygen , sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from redox hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel , oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using dissolved oxygen , metal oxides ( e.g in the deep sea , hydrothermal vents and cold seeps with high levels of hydrogen sulfide are home to a number of extremely specialized lifeforms , ranging from bacteria to fish because of the absence of light at these depths , these ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis in particular , a buildup of hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere may have caused , or at least contributed to , the permian-triassic extinction event 252 million years ago the increased levels of hydrogen sulfide could have killed oxygen-generating plants as well as depleted the ozone layer , causing further stress
