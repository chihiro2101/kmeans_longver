by analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential ( ssep ) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase new york : elsevier , 672 pp in principle , a sinusoidally modulated stimulus can elicit a ssep even when its repetition frequency is low , four ) sseps to be recorded simultaneously from any given location on the scalp for example , when two unpatterned lights are modulated at slightly different frequencies ( f1 and f2 ) and superimposed , multiple nonlinear cross-modulation components of frequency ( mf1 Â± nf2 ) are created in the ssep , where m and n are integers by frequency-tagging two superimposed gratings , spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties of the brain mechanisms that process spatial form can be isolated and studied the existence of a ( 2fv + 2fa ) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain , and the distribution of this response over the head allowed this brain area to be localized . the '' sweep '' technique this technique allows the ssep to directly control the stimulus that elicits the ssep without the conscious intervention of the experimental subject for example , the running average of the ssep can be arranged to increase the luminance of a checkerboard stimulus if the amplitude of the ssep falls below some predetermined value , and to decrease luminance if it rises above this value sensory evoked potentials ( sep ) are recorded from the central nervous system following stimulation of sense organs , for example , visual evoked potentials elicited by a flashing light or changing pattern on a monitor , o'shea , r , & bach , m ) , encyclopedia of perception ( vol los angeles : sage there are three kinds of evoked potentials in widespread clinical use : auditory evoked potentials , usually recorded from the scalp but originating at brainstem level ; visual evoked potentials , and somatosensory evoked potentials , which are elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve electrodes are placed on infant 's head over visual cortex and a gray field is presented alternately with a checkerboard or grating pattern it 's an objective way to measure infant 's visual acuity clinical recovery and visual improvement come with p100 restoration but with an abnormal increased latency that continues indefinitely , and hence , it maybe useful as an indicator of previous or subclinical optic neuritis ciganek developed the first nomenclature for occipital eeg components in 1961 however , it is beneficial to use this type of stimulus when testing infants , animals or individuals with poor visual acuity these squares and stripes are equal in size and are presented , one image at a time , via a computer screen somatosensory evoked potentials ( sseps ) are ep recorded from the brain or spinal cord when stimulating peripheral nerve repeatedly sseps are used in neuromonitoring to assess the function of a patient 's spinal cord during surgery ssep can be used for prognosis in patients with severe traumatic head injury typically , in the operating room , over 100 and up to 1,000 averages must be used to adequately resolve the evoked potential the most predominant peaks have been studied and named in labs dramatic increases in latency or decreases in amplitude are indicators of neurological dysfunction during surgery , the large amounts of anesthetic gases used can affect the amplitude and latencies of sseps the part of the somatosensory system that transmits pain and temperature signals is monitored using laser evoked potentials ( lep ) transcranial magnetic stimulation versus electrical stimulation is generally regarded as unsuitable for intraoperative monitoring because it is more sensitive to anesthesia
