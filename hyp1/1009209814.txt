aeneid , i.282 ; martial , xiv.124 it represented adult male citizenship and its attendant rights , freedoms and responsibilities . freeborn boys , and some freeborn girls , before they came of age . some priesthoods , including the pontifices , epulones , the augurs , and the arval brethren livy , xxvii.8,8 and xxxiii.42 ( as cited by the dictionary of greek and roman antiquities ) toga candida is the etymological source of the word candidate during the empire , it was worn by consuls and emperors . as '' national dress '' the toga 's most distinguishing feature was its semi-circular shape , which sets it apart from other cloaks of antiquity like the greek himation or pallium landowning aristocrats occupied most seats in the senate and held the most senior magistracies magistrates were elected by their peers and '' the people '' ; in roman constitutional theory , they ruled by consent in practice , they were a mutually competitive oligarchy , reserving the greatest power , wealth and prestige for their class the highest-status toga , the solidly purple , gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest-ranking magistrates romans categorised it as a blood-red hue , which sanctified its wearer on coming of age , he also gave his protective bulla into the care of the family lares respectable women , the sons of freeborn men , and provincials during the early empire could hold lesser forms of citizenship ; they were protected by law but could not vote , or stand for public office his wife fetches it and he puts it on then he is told that he has been appointed dictator conversely , the costly , full-length toga seems to have been a rather awkward mark of distinction when worn by '' the wrong sort '' most citizens who owned a toga would have cherished it as a costly material object , and worn it when they must for special occasions he wore it at his funeral , and it probably served as his shroud . despite the overwhelming quantity of roman togate portraits at every social level , and in every imaginable circumstance , at most times rome 's thoroughfares would have been with crowded with citizens and non-citizens in a variety of colourful garments , with few togas in evidence . vout ( 1996 ) suggests that the toga 's most challenging qualities as garment fitted the romans ' view of themselves and their civilization a good client canvassed political support for his patron , or his patron 's nominee ; he advanced his patron 's interests using his own business , family and personal connections to impress his peers and inferiors , and stay ahead in the game , a patron should have as many high-quality clients as possible ; or at least , he should seem to the left arm should only be raised so far as to form a right angle at the elbow , while the edge of the toga should fall in equal lengths on either side institutio oratoria , 11.3.131‒149 . aulus gellius claimed that the earliest romans , famously tough , virile and dignified , had worn togas with no undergarment ; not even a skimpy tunic the manly toga itself could signify corruption , if worn too loosely , or worn over a long-sleeved , '' effeminate '' tunic , or woven too fine and thin , near transparent the augustan principate brought peace , and declared its intent as the restoration of true republican order , morality and tradition he ordered that any theatre-goer in dark ( or coloured or dirty ) clothing be sent to the back seats , traditionally reserved for those who had no toga ; ordinary or common women , freedmen , low-class foreigners and slaves he reserved the most honourable seats , front of house , for senators and equites ; this was how it had always been , before the chaos of the civil wars ; or rather , how it was supposed to have been infuriated by the sight of a darkly clad throng of men at a public meeting , he sarcastically quoted virgil at them , '' romanos , rerum dominos , gentemque togatam '' ( '' romans , lords of the world and the toga-wearing people '' ) , then ordered that in future , the aediles ban anyone not wearing the toga from the forum and its environs – rome 's '' civic heart '' meretrices might have been expected or perhaps compelled , at least in public , to wear the '' female toga '' ( toga muliebris ) in this context , modern sources understand the toga – or perhaps merely the description of particular women as togata – as an instrument of inversion and realignment ; a respectable ( thus stola-clad ) woman should be demure , sexually passive , modest and obedient , morally impeccable an adulterous matron betrayed her family and reputation ; and if found guilty , and divorced , the law forbade her remarriage to a roman citizen . as part of a peace settlement of 205 bc , two formerly rebellious spanish tribes provided roman troops with togas and heavy cloaks ; in 206 bc , scipio africanus was sent 1,200 togas and 12,000 tunics for his operations in north africa a dishonourable discharge meant infamia he employs the phrase cedant arma togae ( '' let arms yield to the toga '' ) , meaning '' may peace replace war '' , or '' may military power yield to civilian power '' , in the context of his own uneasy alliance with pompey in contrast to etruscan , greek and other foreign practices '' ; ; citing as the standard source ; an officiant capite velato who needed free use of both hands to perform ritual could employ the '' gabinian cincture '' ( cinctus gabinus ) , which tied the toga back to minimise waste , the smaller , old-style forms of toga may have been woven as a single , seamless , selvedged piece ; the later , larger versions may have been made from several pieces sewn together ; size seems to have counted for a lot the more volumious and complex the style , the more assistance would have been required to achieve the desired effect . high-status ( consular or senatorial ) images from the late 4th century show a further ornate variation , known as the '' broad eastern toga '' ; it hung to the mid-calf , was heavily embroidered , and was worn over two pallium-style undergarments , one of which had full length sleeves its sinus was draped over the left arm the extension of citizenship , from around 6 million citizens under augustus to between 40 and 60 million under the '' universal citizenship '' of caracalla 's constitutio antoniniana ( 212 ad ) , probably further reduced whatever distinctive value the toga still held for commoners , and accelerated its abandonment among their class . byzantine art show the highest functionaries of court , church and state in magnificently wrought , extravagantly exclusive court dress and priestly robes ; some at least are thought to be versions of the imperial toga
