the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) gh release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides , which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators ( e.g , exercise , nutrition , sleep ) and inhibitors ( e.g the largest and most predictable of these gh peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 & nbsp ; ng/ml otherwise there is wide variation between days and individuals hypoglycemia , arginine and propranolol by inhibiting somatostatin release deep sleep insulin glucagon niacin as nicotinic acid ( vitamin b 3 ) fasting vigorous exercise inhibitors of gh secretion include : ghih ( somatostatin ) from the periventricular nucleus circulating concentrations of gh and igf-1 ( negative feedback on the pituitary and hypothalamus ) hyperglycemia glucocorticoids dihydrotestosterone phenothiazines in addition to control by endogenous and stimulus processes , a number of foreign compounds ( xenobiotics such as drugs and endocrine disruptors ) are known to influence gh secretion and function like most other protein hormones , gh acts by interacting with a specific receptor on the surface of cells in addition to increasing height in children and adolescents , growth hormone has many other effects on the body : increases calcium retention , and strengthens and increases the mineralization of bone increases muscle mass through sarcomere hypertrophy promotes lipolysis increases protein synthesis stimulates the growth of all internal organs excluding the brain plays a role in homeostasis reduces liver uptake of glucose promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver contributes to the maintenance and function of pancreatic islets stimulates the immune system increases deiodination of t4 to t3 t.f ) , a case-based guide to clinical endocrinology , 2008 , pag.16 diagnosis of gh deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process , usually culminating in gh stimulation tests to see if the patient 's pituitary gland will release a pulse of gh when provoked by various stimuli several studies , primarily involving patients with gh deficiency , have suggested a crucial role of gh in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level in these patients , benefits have variably included reduced fat mass , increased lean mass , increased bone density , improved lipid profile , reduced cardiovascular risk factors , and improved psychosocial well-being dea , us department of justice despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that gh had reversed the aging process itself , their results were misinterpreted as indicating that gh is an effective anti-aging agent stephen barrett , m.d introduction to pharmacology , third edition and some articles in the popular press , such as those criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for marketing drugs for off-label use ( with concern of ethics violations ) have made strong statements about whether doctors can prescribe hgh off-label : '' unlike other prescription drugs , hgh may be prescribed only for specific uses sales are limited by law to treat a rare growth defect in children and a handful of uncommon conditions like short bowel syndrome or prader-willi syndrome , a congenital disease that causes reduced muscle tone and a lack of hormones in sex glands sometimes it 's used appropriately one survey of adults that had been treated with replacement cadaver gh ( which has not been used anywhere in the world since 1985 ) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer , but linkage with the gh treatment was not established many athletic societies ban the use of gh and will issue sanctions against athletes who are caught using it the ftc and the fda do enforce the law when they become aware of violations in the united states , it is legal to give a bovine gh to dairy cows to increase milk production , and is legal to use gh in raising cows for beef ; see article on bovine somatotropin , cattle feeding , dairy farming and the beef hormone controversy ( and ) there was a retention of potassium , phosphorus , calcium , and sodium no change in glucose tolerance was demonstrable on the fifth day of administration of monkey growth hormone in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s in 2006 , the u.s food and drug administration ( fda ) approved a version of rhgh called omnitrope ( sandoz )
