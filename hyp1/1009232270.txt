the theoretical gain ( antenna gain ) of a dish increases as the frequency increases with lower frequencies , c-band for example , dish designers have a wider choice of materials the large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework modern dishes intended for home television use are generally 43 & nbsp ; cm ( 18 & nbsp ; in ) to 80 & nbsp ; cm ( 31 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter , and are fixed in one position , for ku-band reception from one orbital position lower frequencies are allocated to cable and terrestrial tv , fm radio , etc only one of these frequency bands fits on the coaxial cable , so each of these bands needs a separate cable from the lnbf to a switching matrix or the receiver needs to select one of the 4 possibilities at a time the receiver uses different power supply voltages ( 13 / 18 v ) to select vertical / horizontal antenna polarization , and an on/off pilot tone ( 22 & nbsp ; khz ) to instruct the lnb to select one of the two frequency bands in larger installations each band and polarization is given its own cable , so there are 4 cables from the lnb to a 'multiswitch ' switching matrix , which allows the connection of multiple receivers to the multiswitch in a star topology using the same signalling method as in a single receiver installation with diseqc and usals , the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote the vertical axis operates as an off-axis concave parabolic concave hyperbolic cassegrain reflector , while the horizontal axis operates as a concave convex cassegrain this provides two way satellite internet communications for both individuals and private networks for organizations sky minidish.jpg sky '' minidish '' dishing out the truth.jpg satellite dishes installed on an apartment complex 06-06-2014 fonte de agua em dato rua , fohorem 6.jpg satellite dish at a hut in east timor the first satellite television dishes were built to receive signals on the c-band analog , and were very large the dishes were nearly in diameter
