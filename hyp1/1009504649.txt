when lee et al elegans , drosophila and human cells at this point , researchers started using the term '' microrna '' to refer to this class of small regulatory rnas the first human disease associated with deregulation of mirnas was chronic lymphocytic leukemia.in this disorder the mirnas have a dual role working as both tumor suppressors and oncogene for example , mir-124 was named and likely discovered prior to mir-456 a capitalized '' mir- '' refers to the mature form of the mirna , while the uncapitalized '' mir- '' refers to the pre-mirna and the -mirna the mirnas encoding genes are also named using the same three-letter prefix according to the conventions of the organism gene nomenclature , -mir-124 is a human ( homo sapiens ) mirna and oar-mir-124 is a sheep ( ovis aries ) mirna estimates of the average number of unique messenger rnas that are targets for repression by a typical mirna vary , depending on the estimation method , but multiple approaches show that mammalian mirnas can have many unique targets other b cell malignancies followed mirna genes are usually transcribed by rna polymerase ii ( pol ii ) these hairpin loop structures are composed of about 70 nucleotides each in this complex , dgcr8 orients the catalytic rnase iii domain of drosha to liberate hairpins from pri-mirnas by cleaving rna about eleven nucleotides from the hairpin base ( one helical dsrna turn into the stem ) sequence motifs downstream of the pre-mirna that are important for efficient processing have been identified exportin-5-mediated transport to the cytoplasm is energy-dependent , using guanosine triphosphate ( gtp ) bound to the ran protein in the cytoplasm , the pre-mirna hairpin is cleaved by the rnase iii enzyme dicer the duplex is then transported out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm by a protein called hasty ( hst ) , an exportin 5 homolog , where they disassemble and the mature mirna is incorporated into the risc the position of the stem-loop may also influence strand choice argonautes are needed for mirna-induced silencing and contain two conserved rna binding domains : a paz domain that can bind the single stranded 3 ' end of the mature mirna and a piwi domain that structurally resembles ribonuclease h and functions to interact with the 5 ' end of the guide strand the human genome encodes eight argonaute proteins divided by sequence similarities into two families : ago ( with four members present in all mammalian cells and called e1f2c/hago in humans ) , and piwi ( found in the germ line and hematopoietic stem cells ) it has been demonstrated that given complete complementarity between the mirna and target mrna sequence , ago2 can cleave the mrna and lead to direct mrna degradation such regulation is typically achieved by the virtue of negative feedback loops or incoherent feed-forward loop uncoupling protein output from mrna transcription in what has been called a '' use it or lose it '' strategy , argonaute may preferentially retain mirnas with many targets over mirnas with few or no targets , leading to degradation of the non-targeting molecules decay of mature mirnas in caenorhabditis elegans is mediated by the 5'-to-3 ' exoribonuclease xrn2 , also known as rat1p the 2'-o-conjugated methyl groups block the addition of uracil ( u ) residues by uridyltransferase enzymes , a modification that may be associated with mirna degradation ) located in 5'utr region the actual work of rna silencing is performed by risc in which the main catalytic subunit is one of the argonaute proteins ( ago ) , and mirna serves as a template for recognizing specific mrna sequences in animals the match-ups are imperfect however , genes involved in functions common to all cells , such as gene expression , have relatively fewer microrna target sites and seem to be under selection to avoid targeting by micrornas dsrna can also activate gene expression , a mechanism that has been termed '' small rna-induced gene activation '' or rnaa mirna global regulation of many downstream genes deems significant regarding the reorganization or synaptic connections or long term neural adaptations involving the behavioral change from alcohol consumption to withdrawal and/or dependence bdnf plays a critical role in the formation and maturation of new neurons and synapses , suggesting a possible implication in synapse growth/synaptic plasticity in alcohol abusers alternatively , overexpressing mir-382 resulted in attenuated drinking and the inhibition of drd1 and delta fosb upregulation in rat models of alcoholism , demonstrating the possibility of using mirna-targeted pharmaceuticals in treatments when let-7 was ectopically overexpressed to mimic accelerated aging , mice became insulin-resistant , and thus more prone to high fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes these experimental findings suggest that let-7 inhibition could represent a new therapy for obesity and type 2 diabetes when the human genome project mapped its first chromosome in 1999 , it was predicted the genome would contain over 100,000 protein coding genes
