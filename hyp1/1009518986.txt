the resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete dielectric breakdown of the material nuclear chain reaction ( the concept behind nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons ) '' due to the exponential rate of increase , at any point in the chain reaction 99 % of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations if a slow processor can solve problems of size x in time t , then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size x + constant in the same time t with media such as social networks , one person can forward the same content to many people simultaneously , who then spread it to even more people , and so on , causing rapid spread growth rates may also be faster than exponential below are some stories that emphasize this bias according to an old legend , vizier sissa ben dahir presented an indian king sharim with a beautiful handmade chessboard french children are offered a riddle , which shows an aspect of exponential growth : '' the apparent suddenness with which an exponentially growing quantity approaches a fixed limit '' the plant doubles in size every day and , if left alone , it would smother the pond in 30 days killing all the other living things in the water accelerating change albert allen bartlett arthrobacter asymptotic notation bacterial growth bounded growth cell growth exponential algorithm expspace exptime hausdorff dimension hyperbolic growth information explosion law of accelerating returns list of exponential topics logarithmic growth logistic function malthusian growth model menger sponge moore 's law quadratic growth stein 's law meadows , jørgen randers , and william w new york : university books thomson , david g albert bartlett : arithmetic , population and energy — streaming video and audio 58 min
