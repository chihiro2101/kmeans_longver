the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa tsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar , during which they have the typical appearance of maggots tsetse next develop a hard external case , the puparium , and become pupae & mdash ; small , hard-shelled , oblongs with two distinctive , small , dark lobes at the tail ( breathing ) end the trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named trypanosoma brucei brucei a recent molecular study using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggests that the three subspecies are polyphyletic , so the elucidation of the strains of t animal trypanosomiasis , also called nagana when it occurs in cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in domestic pigs , is caused by several trypanosome species the course of the disease in animals is similar to the course of sleeping sickness in humans other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly international research conducted by ilri in nigeria , the democratic republic of the congo and kenya has shown that the n'dama is the most resistant breed paat technical and scientific series no tsetse fly eradication programmes are complex and logistically demanding activities and usually involve the integration of different control tactics , such as trypanocidal drugs , impregnated treated targets ( itt ) , insecticide-treated cattle ( itc ) , aerial spraying ( sequential aerosol technique - sat ) and in some situations the release of sterile males ( sterile insect technique – sit ) the use of chemicals as attractants to lure tsetse to the traps has been studied extensively in the late 20th century , but this has mostly been of interest to scientists rather than as an economically reasonable solution this method is in the final stage of testing ( as of 2006 ) therefore , the integration of the sit as the last component of an area-wide integrated approach is essential in many situations to achieve complete eradication of the different tsetse populations , particularly in areas of more dense vegetation & randolph , t.f report prepared for the international atomic energy agency iaea , vienna , austria in the niayes region of senegal , a coastal area close to dakar , livestock keeping was difficult due to the presence of a population of glossina palpalis gambiensis after completion of the feasibility studies ( 2006–2010 ) , an area-wide integrated eradication campaign that included an sit component was started in 2011 , and by 2015 , the niayes region had become almost tsetse fly free effect on societal development agriculture ( measured by the usage of large domesticated animals , intensive agriculture , plow use and female participation rate in agriculture ) as well as institutions ( measured by the appearance of indigenous slavery and levels of centralization ) would have been more like those found in eurasia while the fly definitely had a relevant influence on the adoption of new technologies in africa , it has been contended that it does not represent the single root cause . resistance of tsetse flies to trypanosome infection david bruce ( microbiologist ) g.d hale carpenter joined the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , and took the dm in 1913 with a dissertation on the tsetse fly ( glossina palpalis ) and sleeping sickness
