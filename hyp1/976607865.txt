for this to happen , the water body must enter a restricted environment where water input into this environment remains below the net rate of evaporation ) , pearson prentice hall , upper saddle river , nj , 662 p at this point , the mineral gypsum begins to form , which is then followed by halite at 10 % , excluding carbonate minerals that tend not to be evaporites common minerals that are found in these deposits include blödite , borax , epsomite , gaylussite , glauberite , mirabilite , thenardite and trona this , however , does not make non-marine deposits any less important ; these deposits often help to paint a picture into past earth climates evaporite depositional environments that meet the above conditions include : graben areas and half-grabens within continental rift environments fed by limited riverine drainage , usually in subtropical or tropical environments example environments at the present that match this is the denakil depression , ethiopia ; death valley , california graben environments in oceanic rift environments fed by limited oceanic input , leading to eventual isolation and evaporation examples include the red sea , and the dead sea in jordan and israel internal drainage basins in arid to semi-arid temperate to tropical environments fed by ephemeral drainage example environments at the present include the simpson desert , western australia , the great salt lake in utah non-basin areas fed exclusively by groundwater seepage from artesian waters example environments include the seep-mounds of the victoria desert , fed by the great artesian basin , australia restricted coastal plains in regressive sea environments examples include the sabkha deposits of iran , saudi arabia , and the red sea ; the garabogazköl of the caspian sea drainage basins feeding into extremely arid environments examples include the chilean deserts , certain parts of the sahara , and the namib the most significant known evaporite depositions happened during the messinian salinity crisis in the basin of the mediterranean encyclopedia of earth , eds economic importance of evaporites halite formations are famous for their ability to form diapirs , which produce ideal locations for trapping petroleum deposits some evaporite minerals , such as hanksite , are from multiple groups evaporite minerals start to precipitate when their concentration in water reaches such a level that they can no longer exist as solutes
