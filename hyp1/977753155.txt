photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels all in-camera meters are reflected-light meters when using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter , for example orthochromatic black-and-white or infrared film , the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film densitometers are used in photographic reproduction the calibration of photographic light meters is covered by iso 2720:1974 for reflected-light meters , camera settings are related to iso speed and subject luminance by the reflected-light exposure equation : \frac where “ effective scene illuminance ” is that measured by a meter with a hemispherical receptor cameras with internal meters calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by iso 2721:1982 ; nonetheless , many manufacturers specify ( though seldom state ) exposure calibration in terms of k , and many calibration instruments ( e.g the instructions also recommend that the test card be held vertically and faced in a direction midway between the sun and the camera ; similar directions are also given in the kodak professional photoguide in practice , additional complications may arise many neutral test cards are far from perfectly diffuse reflectors , and specular reflections can cause increased reflected-light meter readings that , if followed , would result in underexposure in scientific research & development uses , a light meter consists of a radiometer ( the electronics/readout ) , a photo-diode or sensor ( generates an output when exposed to electromagnetic radiation/light ) a filter ( used to modify the incoming light so only the desired portion of incoming radiation reaches the sensor ) and a cosine correcting input optic ( assures the sensor can see the light coming in from all directions accurately ) lux sec or j/cm^2 although a light meter can take the form of a very simple handheld tool with one-button operation , there are also many advanced light-measurement systems available for use in numerous different applications rochester : eastman kodak company international organization for standardization jones , loyd a journal of the optical society of america norwood , donald w us patent 2,214,283 , filed 14 november 1938 , and issued 10 september 1940 fluorescent , metal halide , sodium , led and other types )
