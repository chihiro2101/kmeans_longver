in bridges , towers , and buildings the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever , but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever therefore , some truss arch bridges ( see navajo bridge ) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining many box girder bridges are built segmentally , or in short pieces the largest cantilevered roof in europe is located at st james ' park in newcastle-upon-tyne , the home stadium of newcastle united f.c 1 july 2005 less obvious examples of cantilevers are free-standing ( vertical ) radio towers without guy-wires , and chimneys , which resist being blown over by the wind through cantilever action at their base file : riverplace tower in jacksonville.jpg cantilever facade of riverplace tower in jacksonville , florida , by welton becket and kbj architects file : cantilever crown.png this radiograph of a '' bridge '' dental restoration features a cantilevered crown to the left file : ronan point collapse closeup.jpg ronan point : structural failure of part of floors cantilevered from a central shaft increases in engine power through the late 1920s and early 1930s raised speeds through this zone and by the late 1930s cantilever wings had almost wholly superseded braced ones stevens , james hay ; the shape of the aeroplane , hutchinson , 1953 chhabra : the resonistor a frequency selective device utilizing the mechanical resonance of a silicon substrate , ibm j two equations are key to understanding the behavior of mems cantilevers de la fuente and m surface stress on microcantilever , due to receptor-target binding , which produces cantilever deflection can be analyzed using optical methods like laser interferometry yue zhao , agnivo gosai , pranav shrotriya : effect of receptor attachment on sensitivity of label free microcantilever based biosensor using malachite green aptamer a cantilever rack is a type of warehouse storage system consisting of the vertical column , the base , the arms , and the horizontal and/or cross-bracing they are commonly found in lumber yards , woodworking shops , and plumbing supply warehouses a folding cantilever tray is a type of stacked shelf that can be unfolded to allow convenient access to items on multiple tiers simultaneously
