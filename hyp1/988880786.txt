for large n ( and the practical requirements of a phone switch are considered large ) this growth was too expensive the other contacts on the two bars were unused if a crossbar switch could be emulated by some arrangement of smaller crossbar switches , then these smaller crossbar switches could also , in turn be emulated by even smaller crossbar switches this is called a clos network suppose we want to synthesize a 16 by 16 crossbar switch further , on the output side , we could also have 4 output subswitches , each with 4 outputs , for a total of 16 outputs since telephone switches are symmetric ( callers and callees are interchangeable ) , the same logic will apply to the output layer , and the middle subswitches will be '' square '' , having the same number of inputs as outputs it only takes four calls to partially block the switch as the numbers get larger , the savings increase but three layers of 100 100 & times ; 100 subswitches would use only 300 10,000 contact subswitches , or 3 million contacts those subswitches could in turn each be made of 3 & times ; 10 10 & times ; 10 crossbars , a total of 3000 contacts , making 900,000 for the whole exchange ; that is a far smaller number than 100 million the first step is to find an unused link from the input subswitch to a middle-layer subswitch ( which we shall call a ) , and an unused link from a middle-layer subswitch ( which we shall call b ) to the desired output subswitch the algorithm proper only cares about the internal connections from input to output switch , although a practical implementation also has to keep track of the correct input and output switch connections when this is done , each input or output subswitch in the chain has at most two connections passing through it , and they are assigned to different middle switches there may be additional connections through subswitches a and b which are not part of the chain including the new connection ; those connections may be left as-is the result is that the connection moves instantaneously , with an imperceptible interruption to the conversation practical implementations of switches at the time , computers used tubes and were not reliable enough to control a phone system ( phone system switches are safety-critical , and they are designed to have an unplanned failure about once per thirty years ) relay-based computers were too slow to implement the algorithm the printed circuits were designed so that they could be removed and replaced without turning off the whole switch the eventual result was the bell 1ess this resulted in a record for total revenue per trunk although each subswitch has limited multiplexing capability , working together they synthesize the effect of a larger n & times ; n crossbar switch in a modern digital telephone switch , application of two different multiplexer approaches in alternate layers further reduces the cost of the switching fabric : space-division multiplexers are something like the crossbar switches already described , or some arrangement of crossover switches or banyan switches then , a time-division switch is used in the outer layer the multiplexed line is a multiple of a t-1 line each subswitch , and synthesized subswitch is controlled ( recursion ) by logic derived from clos 's mathematics they are being replaced by high-speed internet protocol routers
