mcquillan , isaac richer and eric c 3803 , cambridge , april 1978 john m rosen , the new routing algorithm for the arpanet , ieee trans , one in which the network was divided into areas ) so that each switching node does not need a map of the entire network , only the area ( s ) in which it is included cisco literature refers to enhanced interior gateway routing protocol ( eigrp ) as a '' hybrid '' protocol , despite the fact it distributes routing tables instead of topology maps this is used in some routing protocols that use radio frequency transmission as a necessary precursor , each node in the network remembers , for every one of its neighbors , the sequence number of the last link-state message which it received from that node notes about this stage calculating the routing table as initially mentioned , the second main stage in the link-state algorithm is to produce routing tables , by inspecting the maps this is again done with several steps calculating the shortest paths a node maintains two data structures : a tree containing nodes which are '' done '' , and a list of candidates optimizations to the algorithm in practice , there are a number of optimizations which are used the same concept is used also in the hazy sighted link state routing protocol this can occur since each node computes its shortest-path tree and its routing table without interacting in any way with any other nodes individual nodes use the topology information to compute next hop paths regard to all nodes in the network using shortest hop forwarding paths
