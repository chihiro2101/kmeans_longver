as gpib became popular , it was formalized by various standards organizations & nbsp ; iii the standard was revised in 1987 , and redesignated as ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-1987 ) it was revised in 1992 while ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 defined the hardware and ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 defined the protocol , there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands it increased the maximum data rate to 8 mbyte/s , although the rate decreases as more devices are connected to the bus control and data transfer functions are logically separated ; a controller can address one device as a '' talker '' and one or more devices as '' listeners '' without having to participate in the data transfer in the original protocol , transfers use an interlocked , three-wire ready–valid–accepted handshake they are sometimes called '' centronics connectors '' after the 36-pin micro ribbon connector centronics used for their printers this allows stacking connectors for easy daisy-chaining mechanical considerations limit the number of stacked connectors to four or fewer , although a workaround involving physically supporting the connectors may be able to get around this more information see tektronix . use as a computer interface hp 's designers did not specifically plan for ieee & nbsp ; 488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers ; the focus was on instrumentation hp computer products which used hp-ib included the hp series 80 , hp 9800 series , the hp 2100 series , and the hp 3000 series commodore 's following 8-bit machines utilized a serial bus whose protocol was based on ieee & nbsp ; 488 the data transfer is relatively slow , so transmission line issues such as impedance matching and line termination are ignored very few mass-market personal computers or peripherals ( such as printers or scanners ) implemented ieee & nbsp ; 488
