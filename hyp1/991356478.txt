in this non-inertial frame , one must consider centrifugal force in addition to gravity a critical equipotential intersects itself at the lagrangian point of the system , forming a two-lobed figure-of-eight with one of the two stars at the center of each lobe this critical equipotential defines the roche lobes not representable by a scalar potential ) it is the minimum potential equilibrium among l 1 , l 2 , l 3 , l 4 and l 5 it is the easiest way for the debris to commute between a hill sphere ( an inner circle of blue and light blue ) and communal gravity regions ( figure-eights of yellow and green in the inner side ) l 2 and l 3 are gravitational perturbation equilibria points they are unstable equilibria if the mass ratio of the two stars becomes larger , then the orange , yellow and green regions will become a horseshoe orbit algol variables are the result of such situations the donor star can shrink so small to stop mass transfer , but eventually mass transfer will start again as stellar evolution continues leading to the cases case b happens when rlof starts while the donor is a post-core hydrogen burning/hydrogen shell burning star
