'' ( gödel 1946 in davis 1965:84 ) editors 1990 kurt gödel volume ii publications 1938-1974 , oxford university press , new york , both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine equivalently , a set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is the range of some computable function beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics relative computability and the turing degrees recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) an oracle turing machine is a hypothetical device which , in addition to performing the actions of a regular turing machine , is able to ask questions of an oracle , which is a particular set of natural numbers that is , given such sets a and b , there is a total computable function f such that a has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to e , that is , can be mapped using a many-one reduction to e ( see rice 's theorem for more detail ) admissible numberings are those into which all others can be translated : for further explanation , see the section post 's problem and the priority method in the article turing degree the set is then constructed in stages , each stage attempting to satisfy one of more of the requirements by either adding numbers to the set or banning numbers from the set so that the final set will satisfy the requirement it may happen that satisfying one requirement will cause another to become unsatisfied ; the priority order is used to decide what to do in such an event for example , kummer published a paper on a proof for the existence of friedberg numberings without using the priority method set with an infinite complement not containing any infinite r.e maximal sets ( as defined in the previous paragraph ) have the property that they can not be automorphic to non-maximal sets , that is , if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned , then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set the field of kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic randomness was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by chaitin , kolmogorov , levin , martin-löf and solomonoff ( the names are given here in alphabetical order ; much of the research was independent , and the unity of the concept of randomness was not understood at the time ) there are still many open problems in this area , & nbsp ; x n a tuple of n numbers y 1 , y 2 , on the other hand , jockusch 's semirecursive sets ( which were already known informally before jockusch introduced them 1968 ) are examples of a set which is ( m , & nbsp ; n ) -recursive if and only if 2m & nbsp ; \pi^1_1 of the analytical hierarchy the even more general notion of degree of constructibility is studied in set theory there are close relationships between the turing degree of a set of natural numbers and the difficulty ( in terms of the arithmetical hierarchy ) of defining that set using a first-order logic one such relationship is made precise by post 's theorem a weaker relationship was demonstrated by kurt gödel in the proofs of his completeness theorem and incompleteness theorems the program of reverse mathematics uses these subsystems to measure the noncomputability inherent in well known mathematical theorems '' show that many papers have been published with this terminology as well as with the other one according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers the interdisciplinary research association computability in europe ( cie ) also organizes a series of annual conferences .
