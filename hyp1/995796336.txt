athaulf may have received some additional encouragement in the form of payments in gold from the emperor honorius—since athaulf carried with him as a respected hostage the emperor 's half-sister galla placidia , who had long been his captive once in gaul , athaulf opened negotiations with a new usurper , the gallic jovinus after the heads of sebastianus and jovinus arrived at honorius ' court in ravenna in late august , to be forwarded for display among other usurpers on the walls of carthage , relations between athaulf and honorius improved sufficiently for athaulf to cement them by marrying galla placidia at narbo in january 414 , but jordanes says he married her in italy , at forlì ( forum livii ) although athaulf remained an arianism , his relationship with roman culture was summed up , from a catholic roman perspective , by the words that the contemporary christian apologist orosius put into his mouth , athaulf 's declaration : : at first i wanted to erase the roman name and convert all roman territory into a gothic empire : i longed for romania to become gothia , and athaulf to be what caesar augustus had been but long experience has taught me that the ungoverned wildness of the goths will never submit to laws , and that without law a state is not a state in reply , athaulf acclaimed priscus attalus as augustus in bordeaux in 414 but constantius ' naval blockade was successful and , in 415 , athaulf withdrew with his people into northern hispania the main sources for the career of athaulf are paulus orosius , the chronicles of the gallaecian bishop hydatius , and those of augustine 's disciple , prosper of aquitaine
