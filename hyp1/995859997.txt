suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes when plasma levels of butyrylcholinesterase are greatly diminished or an atypical form is present ( an otherwise harmless inherited disorder ) , paralysis may last much longer , as is the case in liver failure or in neonates conditions having susceptibility to suxamethonium-induced high blood potassium are burns , closed head injury , acidosis , guillain–barré syndrome , cerebral stroke , drowning , severe intra-abdominal sepsis , massive trauma , myopathy , and tetanus high blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 meq per liter mh susceptibility is phenotype and genetically related to central core disease ( ccd ) , an autosomal dominant disorder characterized both by mh symptoms and by myopathy the normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases while this phase is not abnormal and is a part of its mechanism of action , it is undesirable during surgery , due to the inability to depolarize the cell again desensitization occurs at the nerve terminal , and the myocyte becomes less sensitive to acetylcholine ; the membrane repolarizes and can not be depolarized again aqueous solutions have a ph of about 4 the dihydrate melts at 160 & nbsp ; °c , whereas the anhydrous melts at 190 & nbsp ; °c suxamethonium is a hygroscopic compound when studying the drug , animals were given curare and thus they missed the neuromuscular blocking properties of suxamethonium the clinical introduction of suxamethonium was described in 1951 by several groups papers published by stephen thesleff and otto von dardel in sweden are important but also to be mentioned is work by bruck , mayrhofer and hassfurther in austria , scurr and bourne in uk , and foldes in america
