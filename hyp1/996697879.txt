he was playing in a rock band at the time , inspired by jimi hendrix and deep purple after noticing the strings moved freely with the regular nut design , he made a brass nut that locked the strings in place with three u-shaped clamps he installed this nut in his 1957 fender stratocaster rose hand-made the first bridges and nuts , which were quickly picked up by some influential guitarists at the time , such as eddie van halen while fender used floyd rose-licensed vibrato systems previously , this move allowed fender to offer a few models with the original floyd rose tremolo , such as the richie sambora in 1991 , the floyd rose classic stratocaster in 1992 and the set-neck floyd rose strat in 1993 fender used the floyd rose-designed locking vibrato system on certain humbucker-equipped american deluxe and showmaster models until 2007 the bridge ( orange ) balances on a pivot point , being pulled counter-clockwise by the strings ' tension and clockwise by typically one to five springs while the tension of the strings decreases , the tension of the springs increases position iii illustrates the position of the bridge when the vibrato arm is pulled up away from the guitar body this also allows fitting a device to the bridge that can drop the low e-string down to d to extend the tonal variety of the guitar , even during live performance floyd rose original is the oldest model still in production note that the name '' floyd rose original '' is used to differentiate this system from '' floyd rose licensed '' the first original floyds were double locking , but had no fine tuners , so players had to unclamp the nut every time they retuned the guitar the bridge has a narrower string spacing ( 0.400 & nbsp ; inches or 10.16 & nbsp ; mm in this design versus 0.420 & nbsp ; inches or 10.66 & nbsp ; mm of the floyd rose original ) floyd rose speedloader is a redesign developed in 1995â€“1999 and introduced around 2003 that combines floyd rose original with the speedloader system , and requires special strings and is manufactured under license of mccabe us patents for '' macrotuners '' , ie fender deluxe locking tremolo the edge and lopro edge were discontinued in 2003 but were subsequently reintroduced on the signature models of steve vai and joe satriani
