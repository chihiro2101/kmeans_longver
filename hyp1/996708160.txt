group '' note '' > the fissile rule thus formulated indicates 33 isotopes as likely fissile : th-225 , 227 , 229 ; pa-228 , 230 , 232 ; u-231 , 233 , 235 ; np-234 , 236 , 238 ; pu-237 , 239 , 241 ; am-240 , 242 , 244 ; cm-243 , 245 , 247 ; bk-246 , 248 , 250 ; cf-249 , 251 , 253 ; es-252 , 254 , 256 ; fm-255 , 257 , 259 '' fissile '' is distinct from '' fissionable '' as a result , fissile materials ( such as uranium-235 ) are a subset of fissionable materials by contrast , the binding energy released by uranium-238 absorbing a thermal neutron is less than the critical energy , so the neutron must possess additional energy for fission to be possible under this definition , the only nuclides that are fissionable but not fissile are those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission but produce insufficient neutrons , in either energy or number , to sustain a nuclear chain reaction under all definitions above , uranium-238 is fissionable , but because it can not sustain a neutron chain reaction , it is not fissile isotopes with an odd number of neutrons gain an extra 1 to 2 mev of energy from absorbing an extra neutron , from the pairing effect which favors even numbers of both neutrons and protons on the other hand , other than the lightest nuclides , nuclides with an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons ( odd z , odd n ) are usually short-lived ( a notable exception is neptunium-236 with a half-life of 154,000 years ) because they readily beta decay to their isobars with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons ( even z , even n ) becoming much more stable the physical basis for this phenomenon also comes from the pairing effect in nuclear binding energy , but this time from both proton–proton and neutron–neutron pairing
