the cp/m operating system was added at the last minute during development the pcw 8256 / 8512 project was code-named '' joyce '' after sugar 's secretary . impact on the computer market '' at its united kingdom launch in september 1985 , the basic pcw model was priced at £399 plus value added tax , which included a printer , word processor program , the cp/m operating system and associated utilities , and a basic interpreter in the us the pcw was launched at a price of 799 , and its competitors were initially the magnavox videowriter and smith corona pwp , two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen , keyboard and printer amstrad became the dominant british personal computer company , buying all the designs , marketing rights and product stocks of sinclair research ltd 's computer division in april 1986 , while apricot later sold its manufacturing assets to mitsubishi and became a software company however , after adjustment for inflation the retail price of a multimedia ibm-compatible pc in 1997 was about 11 % more than that of a pcw 8256 in 1985 , and many home pcs were cast-offs , sometimes costing as little as £50 , from large organisations that had upgraded their systems the pcw 8256 was launched in september 1985 , and had 256 & nbsp ; kb of ram and one floppy disk drive both systems consisted of three units : a printer ; a keyboard ; and a monochrome crt monitor whose casing included the processor , memory , motherboard , one or two floppy disk drives , the power supply for all the units and the connectors for the printer and keyboard there are several techniques for transferring data from a pcw to an ibm-compatible pc , some of which also can transfer in the opposite direction , and service companies that will do the job for a fee the dot matrix printer had a sheet feed for short documents and a tractor attachment for long reports on continuous stationery users who needed to support higher print volumes or to produce graphics could buy a daisy wheel printer or plotter from amstrad in all other respects the 9512 's facilities were the same as the 8512's the pcw 10 was not a success , and few were produced in the magazine pcw plus dave langford expressed a series of concerns about the pcw16 : the operating system could not run the many cp/m programs available for previous pcw models ; the flash ram was too small for a large collection of programs , but programs could not be run from the floppy disk , which was designed for backing up files ; and a second-hand ibm pc with locoscript pro looked like a more sensible upgrade path for users of earlier pcws few pcw16s were sold users had to reboot if they wanted to switch between locoscript and a cp/m application , unless they used a utility called '' flipper '' , which could allocate separate areas of ram to locoscript and cp/m the pcw included a version of cp/m known as '' cp/m plus '' many software vendors supplied versions of their products to run with cp/m plus , making a wide range of software available for the pcw , often very cheaply : alternative word processors included superwriter and wordstar the microdesign , desk top publisher , newsdesk and stop press desktop publishing packages were used by groups of authors for newsletters programs that were already configured for the pcw covered a broad range of requirements including word processors , databases , graphics , personal accounts , programming languages , games , utilities and a full-featured bulletin board system the z80 could only access 64 & nbsp ; kb of ram at a time the rom-based code can not display text , being too small to support character generation ; instead , it displays a bright screen which is progressively filled by black stripes as the code is loaded from floppy the machines were built around the 8-bit zilog z80 processor , running at 4 & nbsp ; mhz , and managed the relatively large amount of ram main memory using a technique known as bank switching ( allowing access to more than the z80 's normal 16-bit address bus reach of 64 & nbsp ; kb ) in cp/m , the memory used for the display was switched out while programs were running , giving more than 60 & nbsp ; kb of usable ram the pcws were not designed to play video games , although some software authors considered this a minor detail , releasing games like batman , head over heels , and bounder in order that it be able to display a full 80-column page plus margins , the display 's addressable area was 90 columns and the display had 32 lines the display was monochrome and bitmapped with a resolution of 720 by 256 pixels this allowed for very rapid scrolling the video system also fetched data in a special order designed so that plotting a character eight scan lines high would touch eight contiguous addresses the pcw16 does not share any hardware with the original pcw series , other than the z80 cpu , and should be considered to be a completely different machine amstrad cp/m plus character set amstrad cpc symbos list of amstrad pcw games ibm displaywriter system amstrad pcw & nbsp ;
