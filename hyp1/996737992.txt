the variable attenuator is commonly called a '' q-switch '' , when used for this purpose at this point , the q-switch device is quickly changed from low to high q , allowing feedback and the process of optical amplifier by stimulated emission to begin alternatively , when the modulator is in its low-q state , an externally generated beam can be coupled into the cavity through the modulator in this case , the q-switch is a saturable absorber , a material whose transmission increases when the intensity of light exceeds some threshold the material may be an ion-doped crystal like cr-yag , which is used for q-switching of nd-yag laser , a bleachable dye , or a passive semiconductor device initially , the loss of the absorber is high , but still low enough to permit some lasing once a large amount of energy is stored in the gain medium image : regenerative amplifier.png thumb right regenerative amplifier bottom : the pockel â€™ s cell-based design needs thin film polarizers electro-optic modulators are normally used for this , since they can easily be made to function as a near-perfect beam '' switch '' to couple the beam out of the cavity a typical q-switched laser ( e.g on the other hand , passively q-switched microchip lasers ( with very short resonators ) have generated pulses with durations far below one nanosecond and pulse repetition rates from hundreds of hertz to several megahertz ( mhz ) however , q-switched lasers can also be used for measurement purposes , such as for distance measurements ( range finding ) by measuring the time it takes for the pulse to get to some target and the reflected light to get back to the sender full removal can take between six and twenty treatments depending on the amount and colour of ink , spaced at least a month apart , using different wavelengths for different coloured inks
