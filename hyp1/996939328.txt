over the years , as the sport has grown , a numbering system was added to rate each ropers individual talent level today there are tens of thousands of amateur ropers who compete for millions of dollars in prize money the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute the freed steer breaks out running in some round-robin format competitions the header and heeler are awarded points for each catch instead of timing the run some of the rules common to most groups include : both riders must start from inside the box if the barrier is broken there is a 10-second or 5-second penalty depending on organization if the heeler catches only one leg there is a 5-second penalty the heeler can not throw unless the head of the steer is turned most synthetic ropes are generally quite stiff at the time of purchase , but come in various grades from softest to stiffest there is the extra extra soft ( xxs ) , extra soft ( xs ) , soft ( s ) , medium soft ( ms ) , medium ( m ) , hard medium ( hm ) , and medium hard ( mh ) headers swing their loops overhead in a smooth , flat motion , aim for the back of the steer 's head and release the loop rodeo steer wrestling steer roping calf roping dally ribbon roping
