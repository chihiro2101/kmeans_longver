, longitude and latitude ) ; those used in the earth 's atmosphere or in outer space are defined in at least three dimensions ( four if time is one of the coordinates , as it might be for some waypoints outside the earth ) these waypoints are used to help define invisible routing paths for navigation for example , artificial airways '' highways in the sky '' , created specifically for purposes of air navigation , often have no clear connection to features of the real world , and consist only of a series of abstract waypoints in the sky through which pilots navigate ; these airways are designed to facilitate air traffic control and routing of traffic between heavily traveled locations , and do not reference natural terrain features what is a waypoint ? garmin if the gps receiver has track-logging capabilities , one can also define waypoints after the fact from where one has been some gps systems intended for automobile navigation can generate a suggested driving route between two waypoints , based on the cartographic database in aerial celestial navigation , waypoints are precomputed along an aircraft 's great circle route to divide the flight into rhumb lines and allow celestial fixes to be more rapidly taken using the precomputed intercept method temporary waypoints are sometimes defined as traffic requires , e.g in aviation , area navigation ( rnav ) —a method of navigation that permits aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of station-referenced navigation aids or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids , or a combination of these—relies heavily upon waypoints some vehicles and vessels are equipped with hardware that is able to automatically send an sms text message when a particular event happens , such as theft or anchor drift the receiving party can ring an alert sound or store the waypoint in a computer system or draw a map indicating the location list of flight information including ( currently , at 8 april 2010 ) 1,951 waypoints ( the wyp lines ) ( latitude ( east ) first ) , for example , the waypoint listed as '' wyp 21.780001 39.866665 islam '' is at or near mecca
