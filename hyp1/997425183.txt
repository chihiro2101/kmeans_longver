nonetheless , in the late 1980s a fifth force , operating on municipal scales ( i.e with a range of about 100 meters ) , was reported by researchers ( fischbach et al over a number of years , other experiments have failed to duplicate this result a scalar field with a long compton wavelength , which determines the range ) another experiment uses the earth 's mantle as a giant particle detector , focusing on geoelectrons the above experiments search for a fifth force that is , like gravity , independent of the composition of an object , so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses forces that depend on the composition of an object can be very sensitively tested by torsion balance experiments of a type invented by loránd eötvös jonathan feng et al ( 2016 ) proposed that a protophobic ( i.e in november 2019 , krasznahorkay announced that he and his team at atomki had successfully observed the same anomalies in the decay of stable helium atoms as had been observed in beryllium-8 , strengthening the case for the x17 particle 's existence '' the atomki group had claimed to find various other new particles earlier in 2016 but abandoned these claims later , without an explanation of what caused the spurious signals
