a spin network , as described in penrose ( 1971 ) , r , oxford , 1969 ) , academic press , pp three line segments join at each vertex for bosons , such as photons and gluons , n is an even number given any closed spin network , a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the norm of the spin network the rules for calculating norms and probabilities are beyond the scope of this article some conventions use labellings by half-integers , with the condition that the sum a + b + c must be a whole number one of the key results of loop quantum gravity is quantization of areas : the operator of the area a of a two-dimensional surface σ should have a discrete spectrum assuming an immirzi parameter on the order of 1 , this gives the smallest possible measurable area of ~10 −66 cm 2 one can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary '' quantum of volume '' and every link is a '' quantum of area '' surrounding this volume later , it was generalized by robert oeckl to representations of quantum groups in 2 and 3 dimensions using the tannaka–krein duality levin and xiao-gang wen have also defined string-nets using tensor category that are objects very similar to spin networks
