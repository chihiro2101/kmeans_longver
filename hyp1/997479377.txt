this has implications for climate research , especially with regards to global warming similarly , near new moon , sunlight that has been backscattered from earth toward the sun and also the moon , which is in almost the same direction , and then backscattered again from the moon toward earth appears much brighter , as viewed from earth , than it would without the retroreflective effects they are thought to have been formed from drops of molten ejecta , produced by impact events , which cooled and solidified before falling back to the surface while terrestrial planet finder-c aims to study the light of extrasolar planets , darwin and terrestrial planet finder-i will search for thermal infrared light that is reradiated ( rather than scattered ) by the planet while the red edge is almost certainly the easiest way to directly detect life on earth via earthshine observations , it could be extremely difficult to interpret a similar feature due to life on another planet , since the wavelength of the spectral feature is not known in advance ( unlike most atomic or molecular spectral features ) & seager , s link and preprint seager , s , & ford , e ( 2005 ) '' vegetation 's red edge : a possible spectroscopic biosignature of extraterrestrial plants astrobiology , volume 5 , issue 3 , pp & nbsp ; 372â€“390 music lee , lifeson
