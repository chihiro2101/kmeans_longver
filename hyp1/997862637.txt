some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions longwave and shortwave transmissions radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations bipm annual report on time activities â€“ ftp : //ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/scale/timesignals/timesignals.pdf time signals , retrieved 2018 july 31 many other countries can receive these signals ( jjy can sometimes be received in new zealand , western australia , tasmania , southeast asia , parts of western europe and the pacific northwest of north america at night ) , but success depends on the time of day , atmospheric conditions , and interference from intervening buildings their model gc-1000 '' most accurate clock '' received shortwave time signals from radio station wwv in fort collins , colorado this oscillator was disciplined , meaning that the microprocessor-based clock used the highly accurate time signal received from wwv to trim the crystal oscillator many modern tv sets and vcrs with ttx decoders can obtain accurate time from teletext and set the internal clock ; l-band and vhf digital audio broadcasting : dab systems provide a time signal that has a precision equal to or better than digital radio mondiale but like fm rds do not indicate clock stratum many modern radio clocks use the global positioning system to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from terrestrial radio stations although any satellite navigation receiver that is performing its primary navigational function must have an internal time reference accurate to a small fraction of a second , the displayed time is often not as precise as the internal clock multicore cpus for navigation systems can only be found on high end products the web site of the international occultation timing association international occultation timing association has detailed technical information about precision timekeeping for the amateur astronomer casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america
