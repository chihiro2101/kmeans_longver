wm −1 k −1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day the result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction , which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas , thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body ( or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit ) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit the elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes , but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with improved seals at wrist , neck and ankles and also usually featuring a waterproof dry-zip in the popular mind , the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation , but bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric '' larry '' marshall who was involved in a u.s navy/national research council panel on underwater swimmers they attempted to patent their neoprene wetsuit design , but their application was rejected because the design was viewed as too similar to a flight suit the first written documentation of bradner 's invention was in a letter to marshall , dated june 21 , 1951 after experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams , o'neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called o'neill in a san francisco garage in 1952 , later relocating to santa cruz , california in 1959 with the motto '' it 's always summer on the inside '' the pêche-sport '' isothermic '' suit invented by georges beuchat in 1953 and the uk-made siebe gorman swimsuit were both made out of sponge rubber '' '' cold water suits '' , spearfishing news july 1951 , p by may 1953 , the bondi underwater equipment manufacturer undersee products was already distributing this singlet-like design commercially to australian sporting goods stores , where it was described thus : '' made from heavy sheet rubber , the sealskin suit is most effective when worn over a football jersey when jersey becomes wet , rubber holds it firmly against body and thus warmth is generated . development of suit design in 1960 , the british dunlop sports company brought out its yellow aquafort neoprene wetsuit , whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety 2 ( march-april 1960 ) , p the colorful wetsuits seen today first arrived in the 1970s when double-backed neoprene was developed improvements in suit assembly the tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a chemical solvent or with a hot rolling heat-sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene initially , suits could be found as being sewn only , glued only , taped only , then also sewn and taped , or glued and taped , or perhaps all three sometime after nylon-backed neoprene appeared , the overlock method was developed the curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene , and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam for example , a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg , neck , and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person 's body moves armstrong , was one of the first designs combining a turtle-neck based on the popular sealsuit with a flexible lightweight ykk horizontal zipper across the back shoulders similar in concept to the inflatable watertight supersuit ( developed by jack o'neill in the late 1960s ) the animal skin eventually evolved molded rubber patterns bonded onto the exterior of the neoprene sheeting ( a technique e.j its name was given because of the steam given off from the suit once taken off allowing heat and water held inside to escape these include , but are not limited to , spandex , and wool precision computer-controlled cutting and assembly methods , such as water jet cutter , have allowed ever greater levels of seam precision , permitting designers to use many small individual strips of different colors while still keeping the suit free of bulging and ripples from improper cutting and sewing further innovations in cad ( computer aided design ) technology allow precision cutting for custom-fit wetsuits with the advances of elastic lycra backings and blindstitching , single-backed neoprene suits could be made that outperformed the early versions from the 1970s a spring suit covers the torso and has short or long sleeves and short legs some suits are arranged in two parts ; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions typically , two-piece cold water wetsuits have 10 to 14 & nbsp ; mm of material around the torso and 5 to 7 & nbsp ; mm for the limbs wetsuits are available in different thicknesses depending on the conditions for which they are intended a thick suit will restrict mobility , and as the thickness is increased the suit may become impractical , depending on the application the cut surfaces of the foam have a slightly porous mat finish as the cutting process passes through a large number of bubbles , leaving what is called an open cell surface finish , but the bulk of the foam remains closed cell it is relatively form fitting and comfortable on the skin , but the porosity encourages bacterial growth if not well washed after use , and the foam surface does not slide freely against skin zippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles , but they also provide leakage points for water jackets may have a full or partial front zipper , or none at all the top of the closure will leak to some extent they are relatively comfortable for most applications , the suit is easy to remove , and they place the zipper directly over the spine , which though flexible in bending , does not change much in length in many water sports such as scuba diving , surfing , kayaking , windsurfing , sailing and even fishing , bootees may be worn to keep the feet warm in the same way that a wetsuit would the bootee should not restrict the ability of a surfer to grip the board with the toes in the desired manner split-toe bootees allow for some improvement in this functionality in cold conditions longer wetsuit boots may be used with a drysuit where they are worn over the rubber drysuit socks measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression shows that about 30 % of the volume , and therefore 30 % of surface buoyancy , is lost in about the first 10 & nbsp ; m , another 30 % by about 60 & nbsp ; m , and the volume appears to stabilise at about 65 % loss by about 100 & nbsp ; m depending on the overall buoyancy of the diver , this will generally require 6 & nbsp ; kg of additional weight to bring the diver to neutral buoyancy to allow reasonably easy descent the volume lost at 10 & nbsp ; m is about 3litres , or 3 & nbsp ; kg of buoyancy , rising to about 6 & nbsp ; kg buoyancy lost at about 60 & nbsp ; m
