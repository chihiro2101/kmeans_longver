western primatology stems primarily from research by north american and european scientists early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower primatology is a science the general belief is that the scientific observation of nature must be either extremely limited , or completely controlled there are three methodological approaches in primatology : field study , the more realistic approach ; laboratory study , the more controlled approach ; and semi-free ranging , where primate habitat and wild social structure is replicated in a captive setting chimpanzees used tools made from twigs to extract termites from their nests jeanne altmann irwin s martin emil wolfgang menzel , jr russell mittermeier john r peres matthew richardson anne e russon jordi sabater pi robert sapolsky carel van schaik robert seyfarth ( scientist ) meredith small barbara smuts craig stanford karen b imanishi was an animal ecologist who began studying wild horses before focusing more on primate ecology junichiro was a renowned anthropologist and a professor at kyoto university he is a co-founder of the primate research institute and the centre for african area studies though kawai is the only japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term , the underlying principle is part of the foundation of japanese primate research a team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories kinji imanishi junichiro itani kawai masao tetsuro matsuzawa toshisada nishida satsue mito the interface between primatology and sociobiology examines in detail the evolution of primate behavioral processes , and what studying our closest living primate relatives can tell about our own minds as the american anthropologist earnest albert hooton used to say , '' '' ( '' i am a primate ; nothing about primates is outside of my bailiwick '' additionally , this interface is of particular interest to the science watchers in science and technology studies , who examine the social conditions which incite , mould , and eventually react to scientific discoveries and knowledge before darwin , and before molecular biology , the father of modern taxonomy , carl linnaeus , organized natural objects into kinds , that we now know reflect their evolutionary relatedness from grooming to speaking the amount of grooming taking place between members of a troop is a potent indicator of alliance formation or troop solidarity the size of the neocortex in a primate 's brain correlates directly to the number of individuals it can keep track of socially , be it a troop of chimps or a tribe of humans fodor 's modular mind hypothesis expands on this concept , suggesting the existence of preprogrammed modules for dealing with many , or all aspects of cognition francine neago in conjunction with ibm this is not what is observed his studies have shown that chimpanzees can recognize whether a researcher desires a dropped object , and act accordingly by picking it up however , it is also possible that baboons do not return call barks for ecological reasons , for example because returning the call bark might call attention to the lost baboon , putting it at greater risk from predators in particular , the use of primatological studies to assert gender roles , and to both promote and subvert feminism has been a point of contention data supporting the authors ' conclusion that cottontop tamarin monkeys displayed pattern-learning behavior similar to human infants reportedly could not be located after a three-year investigation '' author on leave after harvard inquiry '' , the boston globe , 10 august 2010 because of the high number of women , schiebinger has even asserted that '' primatology is widely celebrated as a feminist science '' females on the other hand were described as '' dedicated mothers to small infants and sexually available to males in order of the males ' dominance rank '' females display aggression , exercise sexual choice , and compete for resources , mates and territory , like their male counterparts
