in a letter , synesius asks hypatia , his teacher , to make a hydrometer for him : the instrument in question is a cylindrical tube , which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size you can then count the notches at your ease , and in this way ascertain the weight of the water according to the encyclopedia of the history of arabic science , it was used by abū rayhān al-bīrūnī in the 11th century and described by al-khazini in the 12th century it appeared again in the 1675 work of robert boyle ( who coined the name '' hydrometer '' ) , with types devised by antoine baumé ( the baumé scale ) , william nicholson , and jacques charles in the late 18th century , more or less contemporarily with benjamin sikes ' discovery of the device by which the alcoholic content of a liquid can be automatically determined the hydrometer sinks deeper in low-density liquids such as kerosene , gasoline , and ethanol , and less deep in high-density liquids such as brine , milk , and acids it is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 ( for water ) near the top of the stem , and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom baumé scale , formerly used in industrial chemistry and pharmacology brix scale , primarily used in fruit juice , wine making and the sugar industry oechsle scale , used for measuring the density of grape must plato scale , primarily used in brewing twaddell scale , formerly used in the bleaching and dyeing industries it measures the density of the fluid a higher '' potential alcohol '' reading on this scale is caused by a greater specific gravity , assumed to be caused by the introduction of dissolved sugars or carbohydrate based material a saccharometer is a hydrometer used for determining the amount of sugar in a solution , invented by thomas thomson the sugar level can be determined by reading the value where the surface of the liquid crosses the scale light oils are placed in cooling jackets , typically at 15 & nbsp ; °c a hydrometer calibrated to read specific gravity relative to water at is a standard tool for servicing car battery assaad , philip elmer lamoreaux , travis h dasymeter elevator paradox ( physics ) fahrenheit hydrometer gravity ( beer ) oscillating u-tube pyknometer
