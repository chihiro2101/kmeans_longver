arab astronomers were aware of ptolemy 's constellations , but they included a second constellation representing a fish at andromeda 's feet ν and , μ and , β and , η and , ζ and , ε and , δ and , π and , and 32 and were all included from andromeda ; ν psc , φ psc , χ psc , and ψ psc were included from pisces as per hindu astronomy , andromeda is known as devyani constellation while cassiopeia is sharmishta constellation there is an interesting story of these three characters mentioned in mahabharat devyani is the daughter of guru shukracharya while shar sharmishtha andromeda galaxy hindi wikipedia hindu legends surrounding andromeda are similar to the greek myths she bore many demons for her husband , apsu , but eventually decided to destroy them in a war that ended when marduk killed her it represents andromeda 's head in western mythology , however , the star 's traditional arabic names & nbsp ; – alpheratz and sirrah , from the phrase surrat al-faras & nbsp ; – sometimes translated as '' navel of the steed '' it is 198 light-years away , has a magnitude of 2.06 , and a luminosity of '' the secondary , described by herschel as a '' fine light sky-blue , inclining to green '' , is itself a double star , with a secondary of magnitude 6.3 and a period of 61 years the system is 358 light-years away it is 105 light-years from earth ι and is a blue-white hued main-sequence star of type b8 , 502 light-years from earth ; κ and is a white-hued main-sequence star of type b9 ivn , 168 light-years from earth ; λ and is a yellow-hued giant star of type g8 , 86 light-years from earth ; ο and is a blue-white hued giant star of type b6 , 679 light-years from earth ; and ψ and is a blue-white hued main-sequence star of type b7 , 988 light-years from earth υ and ( titawin ) is a magnitude 4.1 binary system that consists of one f-type dwarf and an m-type dwarf ξ and ( adhil ) is a binary star 217 light-years away the primary is a main-sequence star of type b5 its companion star is of magnitude 8.9 51 and ( nembus ) was assigned by johann bayer to perseus , where he designated it '' upsilon persei ( υ per ) '' , but it was moved to andromeda by the international astronomical union the primary is a yellow-hued giant star of type k0 with an apparent magnitude of 5.7 that is 316 light-years away it is 2,720 light-years away it has a mass of and a radius of the most famous deep-sky object in andromeda is the spiral galaxy cataloged as messier 31 ( m31 ) or ngc 224 but known colloquially as the andromeda galaxy for the constellation the distance he found was far greater than the size of the milky way , which led him to the conclusion that many similar objects were '' island universes '' on their own along with the andromeda galaxy and its companions , the constellation also features ngc 891 ( caldwell 23 ) , a smaller galaxy just east of almach ngc 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of william and caroline herschel in august 1783 it is a loosely scattered cluster in the milky way that measures 49 arcminutes across and features approximately twelve bright stars , although more than 60 stars of approximately 9th magnitude become visible at low magnifications in a telescope astronomers have often associated the andromedids with biela 's comet , which was destroyed in the 19th century , but that connection is disputed andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself is considered to be diffuse , as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as from andromeda itself the observers of the 2011 outburst predicted outbursts in 2018 , 2023 , and 2036
