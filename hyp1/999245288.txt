the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus auerbach 's plexus , also known as the myenteric plexus , is a collection of unmyelinated fibers and postganglionic autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract baltimore , md : lippincott williams & wilkins , 2006 it was discovered and named by german physiologist georg meissner the enteric nervous system has been described as a '' second brain '' for several reasons , via the vagus nerve ) and sympathetic ( e.g however , vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed , the enteric nervous system continues to function in vertebrates , the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons , afferent neurons , and interneurons , all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in the absence of cns input in addition , ens contains support cells which are similar to astroglia of the brain and a diffusion barrier around the capillaries surrounding ganglia which is similar to the bloodâ€“brain barrier of cerebrum blood vessels the word is derived from new latin and comes from the greek peristallein , '' to wrap around , '' from peri- , '' around '' + stallein , '' to place '' hormone secretion is controlled by the vagovagal reflex , where the neurons in the digestive tract communicate through both afferent and efferent pathways with the vagus nerve neurogastroenterology encompasses the study of the brain , the gut , and their interactions with relevance to the understanding and management of gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders
