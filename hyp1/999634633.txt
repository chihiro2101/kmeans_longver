in 1932 , jan oort became the first to report that measurements of the stars in the solar neighborhood indicated that they moved faster than expected when a mass distribution based upon visible matter was assumed , but these measurements were later determined to be essentially erroneous although initially met with skepticism , rubin 's results have been confirmed over the subsequent decades the additional invisible component becomes progressively more conspicuous in each galaxy at outer radii and among galaxies in the less luminous ones their luminosities , kinematics , sizes , and morphologies ) a consistent way to predict the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is to measure its bolometric luminosity and then read its rotation rate from its location on the tully–fisher diagram so , while state-of-the-art cosmological and galaxy formation simulations of dark matter with normal baryonic matter included can be matched to galaxy observations , there is not yet any straightforward explanation as to why the observed scaling relationship exists one of the most discussed is modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , originally proposed by mordehai milgrom in 1983 , which modifies the newtonian force law at low accelerations to enhance the effective gravitational attraction mond is not a relativistic theory , although relativistic theories which reduce to mond have been proposed , such as tensor–vector–scalar gravity ( teves ) , scalar–tensor–vector gravity ( stvg ) , and the f ( r ) theory of capozziello and de laurentis . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter cooperstock , fred i this was the first detailed study of orbital rotation in galaxies the case against dark matter about erik verlinde 's approach to the problem
