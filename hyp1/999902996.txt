the idea of ccpm was introduced in 1997 in eliyahu m , cpm , pert , gantt , etc ) developed from 1910 to 1950s main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are : use of ( often implicit ) resource dependencies , having the overall shortest critical chain ) the inherent uncertainty in estimates is much greater than the difference between the optimum and near-optimum ( '' good enough '' solutions ) ccpm planning aggregates the large amounts of safety time added to tasks within a project into the buffersâ€”to protect due-date performance and avoid wasting this safety time through bad multitasking , student syndrome , parkinson 's law , and poorly synchronized integration a duration is assigned to each task the number of iterations of monte carlo simulation depend on the tolerance level of error and provide a density graph illustrating the overall probability of risk impact on project outcome , their planned duration may not be altered during the project ) , because they are used to monitor project schedule and financial performance the ccpm literature contrasts this with '' traditional '' project management that monitors task start and completion dates if the rate of buffer consumption is low , the project is on target
