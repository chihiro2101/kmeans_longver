in physostome swim bladders , a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut , the pneumatic duct , allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by '' gulping '' air in early life stages , these fish must rise to the surface to fill up their swim bladders ; in later stages , the pneumatic duct disappears , and the gas gland has to introduce gas ( usually oxygen ) to the bladder to increase its volume and thus increase buoyancy for instance , the eel synaphobranchus has been observed to have 75.1 % oxygen , 20.5 % nitrogen , 3.1 % carbon dioxide , and 0.4 % argon in its swim bladder physostomes can '' burp '' out gas , though this complicates the process of re-submergence the swim bladder in some species , mainly fresh water fishes ( common carp , catfish , bowfin ) is interconnected with the inner ear of the fish this increases the ability of sound detection in some deep sea fishes like the antimora , the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure swim bladders are evolutionarily closely related ( i.e , homologous ) to lungs the chondrichthyes ( e.g kardong , kv ( 1998 ) vertebrates : comparative anatomy , function , evolution2nd edition , illustrated , revised sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65 % of all deep sea fish biomass indeed , lanternfish are among the most widely distributed , populous , and diverse of all vertebrates , playing an important ecology role as prey for larger organisms and are served in soups or stews vaquita die in gillnets set to catch totoaba ( the world 's largest drum fish ) johnson , erik l ( 1996 ) biology of fishes , 2nd ed & nbsp ; 283–290 pelster , bernd ( 1997 ) '' buoyancy at depth '' in : ws hoar , dj randall and ap farrell ( eds ) deep-sea fishes , pages 195–237 , academic press .
