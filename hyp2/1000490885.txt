clamence often speaks of his love for high , open places — everything from mountain peaks to the top decks of boats beside the atmosphere ( which could be established almost anywhere else ) the city also was chosen by camus for a more peculiar reason in the 1950s , a bar called mexico city was located much near the zeedijk , at warmoesstraat 91 the novel opens with clamence sitting in the bar mexico city casually talking to a stranger — the reader , some would say — about the proper way to order a drink ; for here , despite the cosmopolitan nature of amsterdam , the bartender refuses to respond to anything other than dutch '' the laughter is thus alarming because it immediately reminds him of his obvious failure to do anything whatsoever about the woman who had presumably drowned years before that evening on the pont des arts represents , for clamence , the collision of his true self with his inflated self-image , and the final realization of his own hypocrisy becomes painfully obvious a third and final incident initiates clamence 's downward spiral angry , clamence exits his vehicle in order to confront the man when someone else intervenes and '' informed me that i was the scum of the earth and that he would not allow me to strike a man who had a motor-cycle between his legs and hence was at a disadvantage '' ( camus 303-4 ) since the blind man obviously can not see this acknowledgement , clamence asks , '' to whom was it addressed ? to the public this realization precipitates an emotional and intellectual crisis for clamence which , moreover , he is unable to avoid , having now discovered it ; the sound of laughter that first struck him on the pont des arts slowly begins to permeate his entire existence unable to ignore it , clamence attempts to silence the laughter by throwing off his hypocrisy and ruining the reputation he acquired therefrom but after the allies land in africa , clamence is arrested by the germans and thrown into a concentration camp — '' chiefly as a security measure , '' he assures himself ( camus 343 ) no , no , it was n't du guesclin ; he was already dead , i believe , for he stinted himself too much '' ( camus 343-4 ) clamence then relates the story of how a famous fifteenth-century painting , a panel from the ghent altarpiece known as the just judges , came into his possession this essentially espouses a doctrine of relinquished freedom as a method of enduring the suffering imposed on us by virtue of living in a world without objective truth and one that is therefore , ultimately meaningless the novel ends on a sinister note : '' pronounce to yourself the words that years later have n't ceased to resound through my nights , and which i will speak at last through your mouth : '' o young girl , throw yourself again into the water so that i might have a second time the chance to save the two of us ! '' a second time , eh , what imprudence ! suppose , dear sir , someone actually took our word for it ? it would have to be fulfilled ! the water is so cold ! but let 's reassure ourselves it 's too late now , it will always be too late 1956 , la chute ( french ) , paris : gallimard 1956 , the fall ( translated by justin o'brien ) 2006 , the fall ( translated by robin buss ) , london : penguin
