the word was newly coined by the writers of the easter proclamation in 1916 since then , the word has fallen out of use as a translation of '' republic '' churchill , the aftermath ( thornton 1929 ) p298 winston churchill gives an account of the first meeting of éamon de valera with david lloyd george on 14 july 1921 , at which he was present lloyd george was a native speaker of welsh and a noted welsh linguist , and as such was interested in the literal meaning of 'saorstát ' '' lord longford , peace by ordeal ( 1935 ) in 1916 , nationalist rebels participating in the easter rising issued the proclamation of the republic in 1917 , griffith 's sinn féin and republicans under éamon de valera came together to form the new sinn féin party in the 1918 general election , candidates of the radical sinn féin party—including many who had participated in the 1916 rebellion—issued a manifesto which included the statement : '' sinn féin aims at securing the establishment of that republic '' '' history ireland , may 2007 , p.56 the second dáil comprised members returned in the 1921 elections for the parliaments of northern ireland and southern ireland ; the third dáil was elected at the 1922 general election as the '' provisional parliament '' of '' southern ireland '' , as provided for by the anglo-irish treaty the ministry was answerable to the dáil which elected its head , known initially as the president of dáil éireann he in turn appointed the ministers a ministry of six was created these were : : minister of finance : minister of foreign affairs : minister of home affairs : minister of defence : minister of local government : minister of economic affairs a number of previous cabinet ministers , notably constance markievicz , were demoted to under-secretary level on 26 august 1921 , de valera had the dáil appoint him to the new post of '' president of the republic '' , so that he would be regarded as the head of state in the forthcoming treaty negotiations arrangements were made in august 1920 for the volunteers to swear an oath of allegiance to the dáil at the height of the irish war of independence , as atrocities committed by the black and tans reached such a scale as to result in the burning of the city of cork ( leading to widespread criticism in the united states and from king george v ) , the republican police and dáil courts reached their zenith , and senior barristers who had qualified within the british courts system also represented defendants in the dáil courts but even after the truce of july 1921 , when the tans had stopped their activities , the continuing effectiveness of the dáil courts and police was seen to be patchy this was in part due to standing down the royal irish constabulary ( ric ) in early 1922 before a new police force was ready to operate ; in the interim the irish republican army ( ira ) , dividing within itself over the treaty , was the only police force the main function of the dáil courts was in resolving civil cases and very rarely dealt with criminal matters the cabinet met frequently , though necessarily in secret , and dealt with everyday matters as well as the conduct of the war at the same time in declaring independence unilaterally for the whole island , the new republic had denied '' equal weight '' to the wishes of britain or the irish loyalists having misunderstood or misread this part of wilson 's formula , the dáil still required his support against his main ally the british view was that the 69 new sinn féin members of parliament had chosen not to take their seats at westminster ( to the relief of the conservative party ) , and that an irish settlement would be arranged after the more important treaties with the former central powers had been signed off , involving sinn féin as the representatives of the majority , whether or not it had proclaimed a republic because its original contents were not seen as workable , the government under david lloyd george abandoned plans to amend the third home rule act enacted in 1914 , having called the irish convention in 1917–18 he had been invited as : '' the chosen leader of the great majority in southern ireland '' , but tried to extend this to a british recognition of the republic de valera replied on 12 september '' our nation has formally declared its independence and recognises itself as a sovereign state '' the same invitation was repeated and negotiations started on 11 october each side in the 1921 negotiations used sufficiently elastic language to enable the republic 's delegates to suggest that what was taking place was inter-state negotiations , while allowing the british government to suggest that it was an internal united kingdom of great britain and ireland matter on 6 december 1922 , the constitution of the irish free state came into effect and the institutions of both the irish republic and the provisional government ceased to exist by 1937 , under a new constitution , the free state became a republic of ireland with the self-designation 'ireland '
