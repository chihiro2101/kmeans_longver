hawking radiation in loop quantum gravity based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed in 2014 carlo rovelli and francesca vidotto proposed that there is a planck star inside every black hole loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is a symmetry-reduced model of classical general relativity quantized using methods that mimic those of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) that predicts a '' quantum bridge '' between contracting and expanding cosmological branches lqc models share features of lqg and so is a useful toy model however , the results obtained are subject to the usual restriction that a truncated classical theory , then quantized , might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory loop quantum gravity phenomenology in string theory , one generally starts with quantized excitations on top of a classically fixed background lqg differs from string theory in that it is formulated in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or kaluza-klein extra dimensions , while the latter requires both to be true it is possible to extend mainstream lqg formalism to higher-dimensional supergravity , general relativity with supersymmetry and kaluzaâ€“klein extra dimensions should experimental evidence establish their existence lqg and related research programs sundance bilson-thompson , hackett et al , has attempted to introduce the standard model via lqgs degrees of freedom as an emergent property ( by employing the idea of noiseless subsystems , a useful notion introduced in a more general situation for constrained systems by fotini markopoulou-kalamara et al smolin and wen have suggested combining lqg with string-net liquid , tensors , and smolin and fotini markopoulou-kalamara quantum graphity the others are experimental , meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail many of these problems apply to lqg , including : can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory ( perhaps as a quantum field theory ) ? is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete ? would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton , or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself ( as in loop quantum gravity ) ? are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory ? the theory of lqg is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity , as is string theory there are substantial differences however
