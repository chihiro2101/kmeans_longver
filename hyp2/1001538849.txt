, modern physics ( hoboken , nj : wiley , 1983 ) , p this review paper collected and refined earlier research into a heavily cited picture that gave promise of accounting for the observed relative abundances of the elements ; but it did not itself enlarge hoyle 's 1954 picture for the origin of primary nuclei as much as many assumed , except in the understanding of nucleosynthesis of those elements heavier than iron by neutron capture cameron and by donald d clayton calculated the first time-dependent models of the s-process in 1961 and of the r-process in 1965 , as well as of the burning of silicon into the abundant alpha-particle nuclei and iron-group elements in 1968 , and discovered radiogenic chronologies for determining the age of the elements the most important reactions in stellar nucleosynthesis : hydrogen fusion : deuterium fusion the proton–proton chain the cno cycle helium fusion : the triple-alpha process the alpha process fusion of heavier elements : lithium burning : a process found most commonly in brown dwarfs carbon-burning process neon-burning process oxygen-burning process silicon-burning process production of elements heavier than iron : neutron capture : the r-process the s-process proton capture : the rp-process the p-process photodisintegration the proton–proton chain reaction cycle is relatively insensitive to temperature ; a 10 % rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46 % , hence , this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up to a third of the star 's radius and occupy half the star 's mass for stars above 35 % of the sun 's mass , the energy flux toward the surface is sufficiently low and energy transfer from the core region remains by radiative heat transfer , rather than by convective heat transfer this core convection occurs in stars where the cno cycle contributes more than 20 % of the total energy , jan rydberg , & ekberg , c , radiochemistry and nuclear chemistry ( cambridge , ma : academic press , 2013 ) , p main sequence stars accumulate helium in their cores as a result of hydrogen fusion , but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion in stars around the mass of the sun , this begins at the tip of the red giant branch with a helium flash from a degenerate helium core , and the star moves to the horizontal branch where it burns helium in its core they fuse helium until the core is largely carbon and oxygen semi-classically , the cross section is proportional to \pi\ , \lambda^2 , where \lambda h/p is the matter wave
