when work ( file transfer or command execution requests ) is queued for a neighbor system , the program typically calls that system to process the work the program can also poll its neighbors periodically to check for work queued on their side ; this permits neighbors without dial-out capability to participate for instance , when the caller responds with their system name , the called system may optionally hang up if it does not recognize the caller , sending the ryou are unknown to me\0 response string and then disconnecting when the s command is received on the called system , it responds with sy if it succeeded and it is ready to accept the file , or snx if it failed , where x is a failure reason if an sy is received by the caller , it begins uploading the file using the protocol selected during the initial handshake ( see below ) within the suite of protocols in uucp , the underlying g-protocol is responsible for transferring information in an error-free form these include a secondary channel that can send command data interspersed with a file transfer , and the ability to renegotiate the packet and window sizes during transmission the packet format consisted of a 6-byte header and then between zero and 4096 bytes in the payload for instance , transfers are started by sending a short control packet with tt 0 ( control ) , xxx 7 and yyy the number of packets in a window , then sending another packet with xxx 6 and yyy as the packet length ( encoded as it would be in k ) and then a third packet that is identical to the first but xxx 5 as a result , the g-protocol has an undeserved reputation for poor performance taylor uucp did not support g , but did support any valid requested window or packet size , so remote systems starting g would work fine with taylor 's g , while two taylor systems could negotiate even faster connections d-protocol was similar to x , but intended for use on the obsolete datakit network t-protocol originated in the bsd versions of uucp and is designed to run over 8-bit error-free tcp/ip links the less-used e-protocol , which originated the honeydanber versions as opposed to t from bsd , differs only in that commands are not packetized and are instead sent as normal strings , while files are padded to the nearest 20 bytes uucp was originally written at at & t bell laboratories by mike lesk by 1978 it was in use on 82 unix machines inside the bell system , primarily for software distribution it was released in 1979 as part of version 7 unix version 7 unix manual : '' uucp implementation description '' by d nowitz , and brian e the rewrite is referred to as hdb or honeydanber uucp , which was later enhanced , bug fixed , and repackaged as bnu uucp ( '' basic network utilities '' ) for example , if machine barbox is not connected to the local machine , but it is known that barbox is connected to machine foovax which does communicate with the local machine , the appropriate address to send mail to would be foovax ! barbox ! user many users would suggest multiple routes from various large well-known sites , providing even better and perhaps faster connection service from the mail sender the '' pseudo-domain '' ending often , particularly in the private sector , uucp links were established without official approval from the companies ' upper management the uucp network was constantly changing as new systems and dial-up links were added , others were removed , etc these files were then published monthly in a newsgroup dedicated to this purpose connections with the internet in the mid 2000s , uucp over tcp/ip ( often encrypted , using the ssh protocol ) was proposed for use when a computer does not have any fixed ip addresses but is still willing to run a standard mail transfer agent ( mta ) like sendmail or postfix '' bang path '' is also used as an expression for any explicitly specified routing path between network hosts that usage is not necessarily limited to uucp , ip routing , email messaging , or usenet 1996 , o'reilly & associates , inc rfc 976 : uucp mail interchange format standard
