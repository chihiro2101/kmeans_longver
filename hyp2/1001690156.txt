the primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects : points , line segments , polygons , polyhedra , etc this brute-force algorithm takes o ( n 2 ) time ; i.e a simple randomized sieve algorithm for the closest-pair problem the following general classes may be distinguished some fundamental problems of this type are : convex hull : given a set of points , find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points some fundamental geometric query problems are : range searching : preprocess a set of points , in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region for the case when the search space is allowed to vary , see '' dynamic problems '' , belonging to the first class finally , in the previously mentioned example of computer graphics , in cad applications the changing input data are often stored in dynamic data structures , which may be exploited to speed-up the point-in-polygon queries this branch is also known as geometric modelling and computer-aided geometric design ( cagd ) the most important instruments here are parametric curves and parametric surfaces , such as b√©zier curves , spline curves and surfaces
