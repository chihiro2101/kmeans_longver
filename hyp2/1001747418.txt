besides having a relatively low melting point , cryolite is used as an electrolyte because , among other things , it also dissolves alumina well , conducts electricity , dissociates electrolytically at higher voltage than alumina , and also has a lower density than aluminum at the temperatures required by the electrolysis this causes liquid aluminium metal to be deposited at the cathode , while the oxygen from the alumina combines with carbon from the anode to produce mostly carbon dioxide while solid cryolite is denser than solid aluminium at room temperature , liquid aluminium is denser than molten cryolite at temperatures around escaped hf can be neutralized to its sodium salt , sodium fluoride in non-agitating static pool cells , the impurities either rise to the top of the metallic aluminium , or sink to the bottom , leaving high-purity aluminium in the middle area there are usually 24 prebaked anodes in two rows per cell compared to söderberg anodes , computer-controlled prebaked anodes can be brought closer to the molten aluminium layer at the bottom of the cell without any of them touching the layer and interfering with the electrolysis this requires the whole cell to be shut down the anode effect is mainly a problem in söderberg technology cells , not in prebaked prior to the hall–héroult process , elemental aluminium was made by heating ore along with elemental sodium or potassium in a vacuum this meant that the cost to produce the small amount of aluminium made in the early 19th century was very high , higher than for gold or platinum bars of aluminium were exhibited alongside the french crown jewels at the exposition universelle ( 1855 ) , and emperor napoleon iii of france was said to have reserved his few sets of aluminium dinner plates and eating utensils for his most honored guests 175,711 ( filed : 23 april 1886 ; issued : 1 september 1886 ) some authors claim hall was assisted by his sister julia brainerd hall ; however , the extent to which she was involved has been disputed in 1888 , hall opened the first large-scale aluminium production plant in pittsburgh it later became the alcoa corporation
