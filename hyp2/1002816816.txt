typical mf radio stations can cover a radius of several hundred miles from the transmitter , with longer distances over water and damp earth mf waves can also travel longer distances via skywave propagation , in which radio waves radiated at an angle into the sky are refracted back to earth by layers of charged particles ( ions ) in the ionosphere , the e and f layers a major use of these frequencies is am broadcasting ; am radio stations are allocated frequencies in the medium wave broadcast band from 526.5 & nbsp ; khz to 1606.5 & nbsp ; khz in europe ; in north america this extends from 525 & nbsp ; khz to 1705 & nbsp ; khz some countries also allow broadcasting in the 120-meter band from 2300 to 2495 & nbsp ; khz ; these frequencies are mostly used in tropical areas these include , as examples , the french mrcc on 1696 & nbsp ; khz and 2677 & nbsp ; khz , stornoway coastguard on 1743 & nbsp ; khz , the us coastguard on 2670 & nbsp ; khz and madeira on 2843 & nbsp ; khz it is analogous to channel 16 on the marine vhf band navtex , which is part of the current global maritime distress safety system occupies 518 & nbsp ; khz and 490 & nbsp ; khz for important digital text broadcasts lastly , there are aeronautical and other mobile ssb bands from 2850 & nbsp ; khz to 3500 & nbsp ; khz , crossing the boundary from the mf band into the hf radio band the most common transmitting antenna , the quarter wave monopole , is physically large at these frequencies , requiring a tall radio mast the most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna ( also known as a ferrite rod aerial ) , made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it mcgraw-hill book company , inc
