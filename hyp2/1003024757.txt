this is known as active camouflage a 2006 theoretical work predicts that the imperfections are minor , and metamaterials may make real-life '' cloaking devices '' practical comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow '' uc berkeley researcher jason valentine 's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum , in a region used in fibre optics : 'instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water , it would actually appear to be above the water 's surface it 's kind of weird for a metamaterial to produce negative refraction , it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used pendry , who theorized the invisibility cloak '' as a joke '' to illustrate the potential of metamaterials , said in an interview in august 2011 that grand , theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown : '' i think it â€™ s pretty sure that any cloak that harry potter would recognize is not on the table you could dream up some theory , but the very practicality of making it would be so impossible there are going to be some disappointed kids around , but there might be a few people in industry who are very grateful for it '' in turkey in 2009 , bilkent university search center of nanotechnology researches explained and published in new journal of physics that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc in fiction , people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means : magical objects such as rings , cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility ( or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off )
