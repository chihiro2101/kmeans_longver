the neighbours of a state simple heuristics like hill climbing , which move by finding better neighbour after better neighbour and stop when they have reached a solution which has no neighbours that are better solutions , can not guarantee to lead to any of the existing better solutions their outcome may easily be just a local optimum , while the actual best solution would be a global optimum that could be different ( note that the transition probability is not simply p ( e , e ' , t ) , because the candidates are tested serially nevertheless , most descriptions of simulated annealing assume the original acceptance function , which is probably hard-coded in many implementations of sa in 1990 , moscato and fontanari , and independently dueck and scheuer , proposed that a deterministic update ( i.e thus , in the traveling salesman example above , one could use a function that swaps two random cities , where the probability of choosing a city-pair vanishes as their distance increases beyond t when choosing the candidate generator one must also try to reduce the number of '' deep '' local minimaâ€”states ( or sets of connected states ) that have much lower energy than all its neighbouring states the physical analogy that is used to justify simulated annealing assumes that the cooling rate is low enough for the probability distribution of the current state to be near thermodynamic equilibrium at all times dual-phase evolution is a family of algorithms and processes ( to which simulated annealing belongs ) that mediate between local and global search by exploiting phase changes in the search space graduated optimization digressively '' smooths '' the target function while optimizing harmony search mimics musicians in improvisation process where each musician plays a note for finding a best harmony all together intelligent water drops algorithm ( iwd ) which mimics the behavior of natural water drops to solve optimization problems parallel tempering is a simulation of model copies at different temperatures ( or hamiltonians ) to overcome the potential barriers ) , ftp : //nozdr.ru/biblio/kolxoz/m/mp/das % 20a , % 20chakrabarti % 20b.k % 20 ( eds '' general simulated annealing algorithm '' an open-source matlab program for general simulated annealing exercises google in superposition of using , not using quantum computer ars technica discusses the possibility that the d-wave computer being used by google may , in fact , be an efficient simulated annealing co-processor .
