james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route in 1769 , robert whitworth looked at a shorter route from bridgwater bay to seaton , following the river parrett and the river axe william jessop surveyed a route between taunton and exeter in 1794 , while another group proposed a canal linking bristol , nailsea , bridgwater and taunton , which was surveyed by william white this was authorised in 1825 , but no further action occurred by this time , the estimated cost had risen to £60,000 it included a embankment at lyng , which was high , two short cuttings , eleven brick-built bridges to carry roads over the canal , and more than twelve timber swing bridges , built to provide accommodation bridges for farms which had been divided by the line of the canal the lock at firepool ( taunton ) had a set of reverse-facing gates , to prevent the canal draining if the level of the river tone dropped by mid-1826 , the canal company had insufficient funds to complete the work , and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit the opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather reconciliation finally came in late 1831 , when the two parties proposed a new act of parliament to authorise the sale of the tone navigation to the canal company they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order this was obtained on 21 april 1837 , and the works were started around 2,400 vessels per year were using the port by 1853 unlike many such acquisitions , the canal was seen as a useful adjunct to the railway network , and was maintained in good order for several years , with the conservators of the river tone continuing their annual inspections , and reporting any defects to the railway company between 1870 and 1874 , income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700 the opening by the great western railway of the severn tunnel in 1886 brought further decline , for the imports of coal and slate from south wales to bridgwater dock and the canal could now be moved more directly the conservators continued their annual inspections , and the infrastructure remained in remarkably good order , compared to many other closed canals the section near creech st michael was even used for swimming lessons for the local school children in the 1930s all permanent bridges were mined with demolition chambers despite concerted efforts , the conservators could not make any progress with the removal of the fixed low-level bridges , which prevented maintenance from being carried out bridgwater docks , which had been used by a small amount of coastal shipping , were finally closed in 1971 : the connection at the docks was stopped up , and the british waterways board were granted permission to cease maintaining the canal for navigation the inland waterways association produced a report , entitled the bridgwater and taunton canal - waterway with a future , suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear country park , and the county planning officer for somerset county council produced a second report , suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration , which the county council duly adopted the canal forms part of the local flood relief system , in winter taking water from the river tone at taunton and discharging it into the parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of bridgwater , near the bridgwater canalside centre the taunton-bridgwater canal is also home to an installation termed the 'somerset space walk ' , a scale model ( 530 million:1 ) of the solar system centred around the 'sun ' at maunsel lock with the planets located along the towpath in both directions the bridgwater and taunton canal by john swayne bridgwater and taunton canal - the route bridgwater and taunton canal from the inland waterways association
