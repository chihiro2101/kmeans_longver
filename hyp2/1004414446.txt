however , suitability of this portion of the spectrum for such communication varies greatly with a complex combination of factors : sunlight/darkness at site of transmission and reception transmitter/receiver proximity to solar terminator season solar cycle sunspot aurora at any point in time , for a given '' skip '' communication path between two points , the frequencies at which communication is possible are specified by these parameters maximum usable frequency ( muf ) lowest usable high frequency ( luf ) and a frequency of optimum transmission ( fot ) the maximum usable frequency regularly drops below 10 & nbsp ; mhz in darkness during the winter months , while in summer during daylight it can easily surpass 30 & nbsp ; mhz this means that at longer distances , where the waves graze the ionosphere at a very blunt angle , the muf may be much higher when a transcontinental or worldwide path is open on a particular frequency , digital , ssb and morse code communication is possible using surprisingly low transmission powers , often of the order of milliwatts , provided suitable antennas are in use at both ends and that there is little or no man-made or natural interference the main users of the high frequency spectrum are : military and governmental communication systems aviation air-to-ground communications amateur radio shortwave international and regional broadcasting maritime sea-to-shore and ship-to-ship services over-the-horizon radar systems global maritime distress and safety system ( gmdss ) communication citizen 's band radio services worldwide ( generally 26-28 & nbsp ; mhz , the higher portion of the hf band , that behaves more like low-vhf ) the high frequency band is very popular with amateur radio operators , who can take advantage of direct , long-distance ( often inter-continental ) communications and the '' thrill factor '' resulting from making contacts in variable conditions antennas for transmitting skywaves are typically made from horizontal dipoles or bottom-fed loops , both of which emit horizontally polarized waves '' hf communications - a systems approach '' , taylor & francis ltd , 1987 johnson , e.e ik1qfk home page ( vlf.it ) smith consultants , los gatos , ca '' high frequency noise '' ( pdf ) '' advantages of hf radio '' codan solar conditions for hf-radio
