until 1991 , the internet was restricted to use only '' for research and education in the sciences and engineering '' march 16 , 1992 memo from mariam leder , nsf assistant general counsel to steven wolff , division director , nsf dncri ( included at page 128 of management of nsfnet , a transcript of the march 12 , 1992 hearing before the subcommittee on science of the committee on science , space , and technology , u.s the most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting , where files can be uploaded via file transfer protocol ( ftp ) or a web interface asp.net , coldfusion , java ee , perl/plack , php or ruby on rails ) also known as a virtual private server ( vps ) , divides server resources into virtual servers , where resources can be allocated in a way that does not directly reflect the underlying hardware vps will often be allocated resources based on a one server to many vpss relationship , however virtualisation may be done for a number of reasons , including the ability to move a vps container between servers the user gets his or her own web server and gains full control over it ( user has superuser for linux/administrator access for windows ) ; however , the user typically does not own the server the user is disallowed full control so that the provider can guarantee quality of service by not allowing the user to modify the server or potentially create configuration problems ( usually web hosts use clustered hosting for their shared hosting plans , as there are multiple benefits to the mass managing of clients ) usually a single machine placed in a private residence can be used to host one or more web sites from a usually consumer-grade broadband connection the host may also provide an interface or control panel for managing the web server and installing scripts , as well as other modules and service applications like e-mail e-commerce , blogs , etc this is different from measuring the uptime of a system uptime refers to the system itself being online a hosting provider 's service-level agreement ( sla ) may include a certain amount of scheduled downtime per year in order to perform maintenance on the systems this scheduled downtime is often excluded from the sla timeframe , and needs to be subtracted from the total time when availability is calculated not all providers release uptime statistics web hosting is often provided as part of a general internet access plan from internet service providers a typical configuration for a linux server is the lamp platform : linux , apache , mysql , and php/perl/python
