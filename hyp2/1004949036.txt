although shapes themselves ( particularly paths ) can be decomposed further into nodes such as spline nodes , it is practical to think of the scene graph as composed of shapes rather than going to a lower level of representation another useful and user-driven node concept is the layer for this reason , many large scene graph systems use geometry instancing to reduce memory costs and increase speed virtual functions are simple to write , but it is usually impossible to add new operations to nodes without access to the source code this requires that the map of types to callbacks or functors be initialized at runtime , but offers more flexibility , speed and extensibility some scene graph operations are actually more efficient when nodes are traversed in a different order â€“ this is where some systems implement scene graph rebuilding to reorder the scene graph into an easier-to-parse format or tree a bvh is a tree of bounding volumes ( often spheres , axis-aligned bounding boxes or oriented bounding boxes ) as one ascends the hierarchy , each node has its own volume that tightly encompasses all the volumes beneath it there are some similarities between bvhs and scene graphs very large drawings , or scene graphs that are generated solely at runtime ( as happens in ray tracing rendering programs ) , require defining of group nodes in a more automated fashion if the user has magnified a document so that only part of it is visible on his computer screen , and then scrolls in it , it is useful to use a bounding box ( or in this case , a bounding rectangle scheme ) to quickly determine which scene graph elements are visible and thus actually need to be drawn depending on the particulars of the application 's drawing performance , a large part of the scene graph 's design can be impacted by rendering efficiency considerations disparate implementations were provided by unix hardware vendors it was designed to run on disparate lower-level 2d and 3d interfaces , with the first major production version ( v3.0 ) completed in 1991 iris inventor 1.0 ( 1992 ) was released by sgi , which was a high level scene graph built on top of performer more 3d scene graph libraries can be found in : category:3d scenegraph apis graph ( data structure ) graph theory space partitioning tree ( data structure ) leler , wm and merry , jim ( 1996 ) 3d with hoops , addison-wesley wernecke , josie ( 1994 ) the inventor mentor : programming object-oriented 3d graphics with open inventor , addison-wesley , ( release 2 ) '' scenegraphs : past , present , and future '' carey , rikk and bell , gavin ( 1997 ) '' iris inventor , a 3d graphics toolkit ''
