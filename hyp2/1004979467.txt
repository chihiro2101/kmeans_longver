although these pseudorandom sequences pass randomness tests , by knowing the algorithm and the conditions used to initialize it , called the '' seed '' , the output can be predicted douglas aircraft built the equipment , implementing cecil hasting 's suggestion ( rand p-113 ) for a noise source ( most likely the well known behavior of the 6d4 miniature gas thyratron tube , when placed in a magnetic field ) it has been a useful source for simulations , modeling , and for deriving the arbitrary constants in cryptographic algorithms to demonstrate that the constants had not been selected maliciously physical phenomena with random properties there are two fundamental sources of practical quantum mechanics physical randomness : quantum mechanics at the atomic or sub-atomic level and thermal noise ( some of which is quantum mechanical in origin ) a simple example is a lamp shining on a photodiode photons travelling through a beam splitter the emitter is saturated with electrons and occasionally they will tunnel through the band gap and exit via the base some of the thermal phenomena used include : thermal noise from a resistor , amplified to provide a random voltage source avalanche noise generated from an avalanche diode , or zener breakdown noise from a reverse-biased zener diode the primary source of randomness typically used in such approaches is the precise timing of the interrupts caused by mechanical input/output devices , such as keyboards and disk drives , various system information counters , etc there are several ways to measure and use clock drift as a source of randomness all via c3 microprocessors have included a hardware rng on the processor chip since 2003 the raw output rate is tens to hundreds of megabits per second , and the whitened rate is a few megabits per second a software implementation of a related idea on ordinary hardware is included in cryptolib , a cryptographic routine library the first is to design the rng to minimize bias inherent in the operation of the generator one method to correct this feeds back the generated bit stream , filtered by a low-pass filter , to adjust the bias of the generator a second approach to coping with bias is to reduce it after generation ( in software or hardware ) let the probability of a bit stream producing a 0 be 1/2 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; e , where −1/2 & nbsp ; ≤ & nbsp ; e & nbsp ; ≤ & nbsp ; 1/2 then e is the bias of the bitstream this is attractive , partly because it is relatively fast whitening techniques such as the advanced multi-level strategy ( amls ) other designs use what are believed to be true random bits as the key for a high quality block cipher algorithm , taking the encrypted output as the random bit stream a similar approach measures task-scheduling , network hits , disk-head seek times and other internal events however , with sufficient care , a system can be designed that produces cryptographically secure random numbers from the sources of randomness available in a modern computer new randomness is added whenever available ( for example , when the user hits a key ) and an estimate of the number of bits in the pool that can not be known to an attacker is kept this is the top-level design of the '' /dev/random '' device in linux , written by theodore ts ' o and used in many other unix-like operating systems the linux '' /dev/urandom '' device is a simple modification which disregards estimates of input randomness , and is therefore rather less likely to have high entropy as a result when enough bits of entropy have been collected , replace both key and iv with new random values and decrease the estimated entropy remaining in the pool ( de ) centralized systems noise generator output should be sampled for testing before being passed through a '' whitener while detecting a large deviation from perfection would be a sign that a true random noise source has become degraded , small deviations are normal and can be an indication of proper operation
