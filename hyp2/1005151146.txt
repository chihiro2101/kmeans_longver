hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment , which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion , thereby generating pepsin ( the active form ) the optimum temperature of pepsin is between 37 & nbsp ; °c and 42 & nbsp ; °c at the mean ph of the laryngopharynx ( ph 6.8 ) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues residues in the p1 and p1 ' positions are most important in determining cleavage probability cleavage is disfavoured by positively charged amino acids histidine , lysine and arginine at the p1 position pepsin cleaves phe 1 val , gln 4 his , glu 13 ala , ala 14 leu , leu 15 tyr , tyr 16 leu , gly 23 phe , phe 24 in the insulin b chain pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux such exposure to pepsin at neutral ph and endocyctosis of pepsin causes changes in gene expression associated with inflammation , which underlies signs and symptoms of reflux , and tumor progression the statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin ; statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases pepsin is used for a variety of applications in food manufacturing : to modify and provide whipping qualities to soy protein and gelatin , to modify vegetable proteins for use in nondairy snack items , to make precooked cereals into instant hot cereals , and to prepare animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates for use in flavoring foods and beverages pepsin was historically an additive of beeman 's gum brand chewing gum by dr pepsin is commonly used in the preparation of f ( ab ' ) 2 fragments from antibodies one or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved , so the two fab regions of the antibody remain joined together , yielding a divalent molecule ( containing two antibody binding sites ) , hence the designation f ( ab ' ) 2 these fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma , because they are not able to bind complement , which could lyse the cells , in staining tissue for electron microscopy the divalency of the f ( ab ' ) 2 fragment enables it to cross-link antigens , allowing use for precipitation assays , cellular aggregation via surface antigens , or rosetting assays
