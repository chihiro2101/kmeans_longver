clay or another material is used for insulation to prevent cracking and loss of surface carbon , quenching is usually performed before beveling , shaping , and sharpening the edge differential hardening technology originated in china and later spread to korea and japan this technique is mainly used in later chinese jian , chinese dao , and the katana , the traditional japanese sword , and the khukuri , the traditional nepalese knife earlier chinese jian from the ancient era ( eg this helps to create a tough blade that will maintain a very sharp , wear-resistant edge , even during rough use such as found in combat 114–115 nova secrets of the samurai sword the insulation layer is quite often a mixture of clays , ashes , polishing stone powder , and salts , which protects the back of the blade from cooling very quickly when quenched japanse swordmaking process ~ www.samuraisword.com this allows the edge to cool very quickly , turning it into a very hard microstructure called martensite , but causes the rest of the blade to cool slowly , turning it into a soft microstructure called pearlite this produces an edge that is exceptionally hard and brittle , but is backed-up by softer , tougher metal sometimes the back of the blade was coated with clay , leaving the edge exposed this gives swords like katana and wakizashi their characteristic curved shapes care must be taken to plunge the sword quickly and vertically ( edge first ) , for if one side enters the quenching fluid before the other the cooling may be asymmetric and cause the blade to bend sideways ( warp ) after quenching and tempering , the blade was traditionally given a rough shape with a draw knife before sending to a polisher for sharpening , smith , pp the hardened portion of the blade ( yakiba ) and the center portion ( hira ) are often given a matte finish instead , to make the differences in the hardness stand out this boundary is often called the '' temper line '' , or the commonly used japanese term , the '' hamon '' the medieval sword in the modern world by michael 'tinker ' pearce – 2007 p the knife is then tempered again to produce the final differential hardness blades guide to making knives by joe kertzman – krause publications 2005 p verhoeven – asm international 2007 p induction hardening is a surface hardening technique which uses induction coils to provide a very rapid means of heating the metal instead , the heat is applied to only a part of the tool , allowing the heat to thermally conduct toward the cooler cutting edge the steel is then heated in a localized area , such as the hammering-end of a chisel or the handle-end of an axe when the light-straw color reaches the edge , the smith will usually dip the steel in water , to stop the process the exact hardness of the soft end depends on many factors , but the main one is the speed at which the steel was heated , or how far the colors spread out beyond the blue color , when the steel turns grey , it is more likely to be very malleable , which is usually undesirable in a chisel fracture mechanics : fourteenth symposium – stp 791 by the american society for testing and materials – astm 1983 pp another way is to partially embed the steel in an insulator , like sand or lime , preventing too much heat loss during tempering eventually , this process was applied to swords and knives , to produce mechanical effects that were similar to differential hardening , but with some important differences the art of blacksmithing by dan w in this way , although it is less time-consuming than differential hardening with clay , once the process starts the smith must be vigilant , carefully guiding the heat however differential tempering does not alter the blade 's shape tempering reduces the hardness in the steel by gradually changing the martensite into a microstructure of various carbides , such as cementite , and softer ferrite ( iron ) , forming a microstructure called '' tempered martensite '' advanced materials & processes , volume 149 by the american society of metals – asm international p a sword tempered this way can not usually have an edge as hard as a differentially-hardened sword , like a katana , because there is no softer metal directly underneath the edge to back-up the harder metal case hardening shot peening
