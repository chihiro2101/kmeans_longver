recently , a second meaning came into use , namely global climate model following phillips 's work , several groups began working to create gcms . atmospheric and oceanic models atmospheric ( agcms ) and oceanic gcms ( ogcms ) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model ( cgcm or aogcm ) a simple general circulation model ( sgcm ) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity examples are programs that solve the primitive equations , given energy input and energy dissipation in the form of scale-dependent friction , so that atmospheric waves with the highest wavenumbers are most attenuated such models may be used to study atmospheric processes , but are not suitable for climate projections ogcms model the ocean ( with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed ) and may contain a sea ice model these models are the basis for model predictions of future climate , such as are discussed by the ipcc while the simpler models are generally susceptible to analysis and their results are easier to understand , aogcms may be nearly as hard to analyse as the climate itself , a latitude / longitude grid ) typical agcm resolutions are between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude or longitude : hadcm3 , for example , uses 3.75 in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude , giving a grid of 96 by 73 points ( 96 x 72 for some variables ) ; and has 19 vertical levels another approach to solving the grid spacing problem is to deform a cartesian cube such that it covers the surface of a sphere this resulted from separately prepared ocean and atmospheric models that each used an implicit flux from the other component different than that component could produce akio arakawa did much of the early work , and variants of his scheme are still used , although a variety of different schemes are now in use coupled aogcms use transient climate simulations to project/predict climate changes under various scenarios which scenarios are most realistic remains uncertain over the same time period , the '' likely '' range ( greater than 66 % probability , based on expert judgement ) for these scenarios was for a global mean temperature increase of 1.1 to 6.4 & nbsp ; °c in a projection designed to simulate a future where no efforts are made to reduce global emissions , the likely rise in global average temperature was predicted to be 5.5 & nbsp ; °c by 2100 ipcc , summary for policy makers , figure 4 , in ( pb : thousands of papers have been published about model-based studies the precise magnitude of future changes in climate is still uncertain ; cubasch et al for the end of the 21st century ( 2071 to 2100 ) , for sres scenario a2 , the change of global average sat change from aogcms compared with 1961 to 1990 is +3.0 & nbsp ; °c ( 5.4 & nbsp ; °f ) and the range is +1.3 to +4.5 & nbsp ; °c ( +2.3 to 8.1 & nbsp ; °f ) currently the ecmwf runs at resolution ecmwf-newsletter spring 2016 as opposed to the scale used by typical climate model runs all climate models take account of incoming energy as short wave electromagnetic radiation , chiefly visible and short-wave ( near ) infrared , as well as outgoing energy as long wave ( far ) infrared electromagnetic radiation from the earth any imbalance results in a change in temperature these models project an upward trend in the surface temperature record , as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher altitudes they also contain parametrisations for processes such as convection that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly coupled atmosphere-ocean gcms ( aogcms , e.g hadcm3 , edgcm , gfdl cm2.x , arpege-climat arpege-climat homepage , version 5.1 , 3 sep 2009 ipcc ar5 , evaluation of climate models with media including videos , animations , podcasts and transcripts on climate models gfdl 's flexible modeling system containing code for the climate models program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison ( pcmdi/cmip ) national operational model archive and distribution system ( nomads ) hadley centre for climate prediction and research model info ncar/ucar community climate system model ( cesm ) climate prediction , community modeling nasa/giss , primary research gcm model edgcm/nasa : educational global climate modeling noaa/gfdl maoam : martian atmosphere observation and modeling / mpi & mipt
