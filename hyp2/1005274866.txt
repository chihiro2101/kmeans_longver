it occurs in mountainous regions in the pyrenees , the alps , the arabian peninsula , the caucasus region , the zagros mountains , the alborz , the koh-i-baba in bamyan , afghanistan , the altai mountains , the himalayas , ladakh in northern india , western and central china an isolated population inhabits the drakensberg of south africa this species is almost entirely associated with mountains and monadnock with plentiful cliffs , crags , precipices , canyons and gorges in ethiopia , they are now common at refuse tips on the outskirts of small villages and towns the bearded vulture population occupies the highlands of lesotho , free state , eastern cape and maloti-drakensberg mountains in kwazulu-natal adult bearded vultures utilise areas with higher altitudes , with steep slopes and sharp points and within areas that are situated closer to their nesting sites this bird is long with a wingspan of females are slightly larger than males it is essentially unmistakable with other vultures or indeed other birds in flight due to its long , narrow wings , with the wing chord measuring , and long , wedge-shaped tail , which measures in length lee , w-s ; koo , t-h ; park , j-y ( 2005 ) the tail feathers and wings are gray the bearded vulture is silent , apart from shrill whistles in their breeding displays and a falcon-like cheek-acheek call made around the nest file : novitateszoologicae18 532 gypaetus barbatus nestling.png nestlings are covered in dark down feathers file : gypaetus-barbatus-bearded-vulture-0b.jpg the juvenile bird is mostly dark file : bartgeier 0505262.jpg the adult has a buff-yellow body and head file : lammergeier or bearded vulture , gypaetus barbatus bearded vultures avoid remains of larger species ( such as cows and horses ) probably because of the variable cost/benefit ratios in handling efficiency , ingestion process and transportation of the remains after dropping the large bones , the bearded vulture spirals or glides down to inspect them and may repeat the act if the bone is not sufficiently cracked they prefer limbs of sheep and other small mammals and they carry the food to the nest , unlike other vultures which feed their young by regurgitation to kill tortoises , bearded vultures fly with them to some height and drop them to crack open the bulky reptiles ' hard shells other live animals , up to nearly their own size , have been observed to be predaciously seized and dropped in flight which are incubated for 53 to 60 days gypaète barbu mhnt.jpg gypaetus barbatus aureus egg – mhnt gypaetus barbatus hemachalanus mhnt.jpg gypaetus barbatus hemachalanus egg – mhnt reintroduction in the alps this method has proven more successful , with over 200 birds released in the alps from 1987 to 2015 , and a bearded vulture population has reestablished itself in the alps the bearded vulture is one of the most endangered european bird species as over the last century its abundance and breeding range have drastically declined it was largely wiped out in europe , and by the beginning of the 20th century the only substantial population was in the spanish and french pyrenees this species is currently listed as near threatened by the iucn red list last accessed on 1 october 2016 , the population continues to decline as the distribution ranges of this species continues to decline due to human development actions that have been implemented include the mitigation of existing and proposed energy structures to prevent collision risks , the improved management of supplementary feeding sites as well to reduce the populations from being exposed to human persecution and poisoning accidents and to also have outreach programmes that are aimed as reducing poisoning incidents this species was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae as vultur barbatus video of lammergeier shattering bones into smaller pieces on which it then feeds at arkive species text in the atlas of southern african birds facts and characteristics : bearded vulture at vulture territory the lammergeier in spain cine and photo work about the bearded vulture in the alps diet information bone-eating vulture and a snow wolf
