in a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system ; however , in a critical iterative project a formal software design document may be used each of the phases may be divided into 1 or more iterations , which are usually time-boxed rather than feature-boxed their motivation for avoiding the waterfall life cycle was that the shuttle program ’ s requirements changed during the software development process an evolutionary approach is preferred … in this approach , the ultimate capability delivered to the user is divided into two or more blocks , with increasing increments of capability.software development shall follow an iterative spiral development process in which continually expanding software versions are based on learning from earlier development recent revisions to dodi 5000.02 no longer refer to '' spiral development , '' but do advocate the general approach as a baseline for software-intensive development/procurement programs human resources : in the incremental model fewer staff are potentially required as compared to the waterfall model guidelines that drive software implementation and analysis include : any difficulty in design , coding and testing a modification should signal the need for redesign or re-coding modifications should become easier to make as the iterations progress user reaction should be solicited and analyzed for indications of deficiencies in the current implementation use in hardware and embedded systems examples of this may be seen in a number of industries these companies , such as spacex and rocket lab , are now both providing commercial orbital launch services in the past decade , something that only six nations had done prior to a decade ago
