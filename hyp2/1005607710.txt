mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) according to an alternative theory by robertson and houston , huastecan stayed in the guatemalan highlands with speakers of chʼolan–tzeltalan , separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by kaufman mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) the reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the maya region ; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite stephen houston , john robertson and david stuart have suggested that the specific variety of chʼolan found in the majority of southern lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub '' classic chʼoltiʼan '' , the ancestor language of the modern chʼortiʼ and chʼoltiʼ languages as maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread , the mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared ethnic identity as maya , the heirs of the maya civilization language has been fundamental in defining the boundaries of that kinship '' this pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different mayan languages , some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language relations with other families examples include linking mayan with the uru–chipaya languages , mapuche , the lencan languages , purépecha and huave other linguists do not support the positing of an especially close relationship between chʼolan and qʼanjobalan–chujean ; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language in mexico the mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010 , whereas the belizean speaker population figures around 30,000 ethnologue report on chʼol de tila , ethnologue report on chʼol de tumbalá , both accessed march 07 , 2007 in the state of tabasco chʼortiʼ : a language of guatemala it was previously also spoken in the extreme west of honduras and el salvador , but the salvadorian variant is now extinct and the honduran one is considered moribund tzeltal has tens of thousands of monolingual speakers ) is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities jakaltek is spoken in the municipios of jacaltenango , la democracia , concepción , san antonio huista and santa ana huista , and in parts of the nentón municipio paul , gary f qʼeqchiʼ ( sometimes spelled kekchi ) , which constitutes its own sub-branch within quichean–mamean , is spoken by about 800,000 people in the southern petén , izabal and alta verapaz departments of guatemala , and also in belize by 9,000 speakers qʼumarkaj , near the present-day city of santa cruz del quiché , was its economic and ceremonial center in some classifications , e.g the kaqchikel language is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from guatemala city westward to the northern shore of lake atitlán gordon , raymond g family tree for kaqchikel , accessed march 26 , 2007 tzʼutujil has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of lake atitlán simons , and charles d dallas , texas : sil international '' sipakapense '' ethnologue : languages of the world , eighteenth edition , ( 2015 ) ixil ( possibly three different languages ) is spoken by 70,000 in the '' ixil triangle '' region of the quiché ( department ) the poqom languages are closely related to core quichean , with which they constitute a poqom-kʼichean sub-branch on the quichean–mamean node poqomchiʼ is spoken by 90,000 people gordon , raymond g ethnologue report on eastern poqomam , ethnologue report on western poqomchiʼ , both accessed march 07 , 2007 población hablante de lengua indígena de 5 y más años por principales lenguas , 1970 a 2005 inegi it remains common in yucatán and in the adjacent states of quintana roo and campeche '' maya , yucatec '' ethnologue : languages of the world , eighteenth edition , ( 2015 ) the other three yucatecan languages are mopan , spoken by around 10,000 speakers primarily in belize ;
