being in an offside position is not an offence in itself a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur in neither of these cases is the player being penalised for being offside ; they are being cautioned for acts of unsporting behaviour however , as with all officiating decisions in the game , adjudicating offside is ultimately up to the referee , who can overrule the advice of their assistants if they see fit a player is in an '' offside position '' if they are in the opposing team 's half of the field and also '' nearer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' there is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from a goal kick , a corner kick , or a throw-in the new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely , but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent an assistant referee signals for an offside offence by first raising their flag to a vertical position and then , if the referee stops play , by partly lowering their flag to an angle that signifies the location of the offence : flag pointed at a 45-degree angle downwards : offence has occurred in the third of the pitch nearest to the assistant referee ; flag parallel to the ground : offence has occurred in the middle third of the pitch ; flag pointed at a 45-degree angle upwards : offence has occurred in the third of the pitch furthest from the assistant referee trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy : if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions , they can be two metres apart in less than a second correction : there have been some proposals for automated enforcement of the offside rule a law similar to offside was used in the game of cornish hurling played in cornwall in the early seventeenth century : school and university football in contrast with the school and university games , surviving rules of independent football clubs from before 1860 tend to lack any offside law in the early 1860s , this began to change sheffield fc also adopted a weak offside law at the beginning of the 1863–64 season the work of j he criticized most existing offside laws for being too lax : the rugby laws , for example , were at fault because they permitted an offside player to rejoin play immediately after an opponent touched the ball , while eton 's rule of four allowed '' an immense amount of sneaking '' when the number of players was unlimited the influence of thring 's views is shown by the adoption of his proposed offside law in the first draft of the fa laws ( see below ) at the first revision of the fa laws , in february 1866 , an important qualifier was added to soften the '' strict '' offside law : at the fa 's meeting , the alteration '' gave rise to a lengthy discussion , many thinking with mr 38 those two schools did indeed become members of the fa after the next annual fa meeting ( february 1867 ) , in response to a letter-writing campaign by newly installed fa secretary robert graham the exact date on which the two schools joined the f.a early proposals for change ( 1867-1874 ) this change was introduced in 1868 ( branham college ) , 1871 ( '' the oxford association '' ) and 1872 ( notts county ) offside was the subject of the biggest dispute between the sheffield football association ( which produced its own '' sheffield rules '' ) and the football association . offside in own half ( 1907 ) the scottish proposal gained support in england a further proposal from the sfa also failed in 1913 , after the football association objected wilson ( 2013 ) , p . attacker level with second-last defender ( 1990 ) the experiment was quietly dropped after the 1974–75 season , as no proposal for a further experiment or rule change was submitted for the scottish football association board to consider under the original laws of 1863 , it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in ; however , since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line , it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball in 1874 , the corner-kick was allowed to be taken up to one yard from the corner-flag , thus opening up the possibility of a player being in an offside position at the international football conference of december 1882 , it was agreed that a player should not be offside from a corner-kick ; this change was incorporated into the laws of the game in 1883 milan , which was highly successful , namely an aggressive high-pressing system , which used a 4–4–2 formation , an attractive , fast , attacking , and possession-based playing style , and which also used innovative elements such as zonal marking and a high back–line line playing the offside trap , which largely deviated from previous systems in italian football , despite still maintaining defensive solidity pages 195–201 give visual diagrams of situations in which offside offences occur or do not occur under law 11
