the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field , which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended , forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move as tweeter technology has advanced , different design applications have become popular many soft dome tweeter diaphragms are thermoformed from polyester film , or silk or polyester fabric that has been impregnated with a polymer resin hard dome tweeters are usually made of aluminium , aluminium-magnesium alloys , or titanium tweeters are intended to convert an electrical signal into mechanical air movement with nothing added or subtracted , but the process is imperfect , and real-world tweeters involve tradeoffs all dome materials have advantages and disadvantages ferrofluid is a suspension of very small ( typically 10 & nbsp ; nm ) iron oxide magnetic particles in a very low volatility liquid , typically a synthetic oil tweeters designed for sound reinforcement and musical instrument applications are broadly similar to high fidelity tweeters , though they 're usually not referred to as tweeters , but as '' high frequency drivers '' high frequency drivers in pa horns are often referred to as '' compression drivers '' from the mode of acoustic coupling between the driver diaphragm and the horn throat image : conetweetermarantz.jpg thumb right the cone tweeter from a marantz 5g loudspeaker cone tweeters have the same basic design and form as a woofer with optimizations to operate at higher frequencies the optimizations usually are : a very small and light cone so it can move rapidly ; cone materials chosen for stiffness ( e.g typical of the 1960s/1970s-era was the cts '' phenolic ring '' cone tweeters , exhibiting flat response from 2,000 to 15,000 & nbsp ; hz , low distortion and fast transient response many designers therefore believed this made them a good match to cone midranges and woofers , allowing for superb stereo imaging cone tweeters are now rarely used in modern hi-fi usage and are routinely seen in low cost applications such as factory car speakers , compact stereo systems , and boom boxes a dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome ( made of woven fabric , thin metal or other suitable material ) , which is attached to the magnet or the top plate via a low compliance suspension the overwhelming majority of dome tweeters presently used in hi-fi speakers are 25 & nbsp ; mm ( 1 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter an audio signal is applied to the crystal , which responds by flexing in proportion to the voltage applied across the crystal 's surfaces , thus converting electrical energy into mechanical some parts of the molecule are positively charged , while other parts of the molecule are negatively charged ) with electrodes attached to two of its opposite faces this alignment of molecules will cause the material to change dimensions this phenomenon is known as electrostriction piezo tweeters rarely get used in high-end audio because of their low fidelity , although they did feature in some high-end designs of the late â€˜ 70s , such as the celef pe1 in which they were utilised as a super tweeter in combination with a conventional dome tweeter planar magnetic tweeters are generally less expensive than true ribbon tweeters , but are not precisely equivalent as a metal foil ribbon is lighter than the diaphragm in a planar magnetic tweeter and the magnetic structures are different these are , nonetheless , a form of horn loading plasma or ion tweeter these types of tweeters are not capable of high output , nor of other than very high frequency reproduction , and so are usually used at the throat of a horn structure to manage usable output levels because of this , german-made magnat '' magnasphere '' speakers were banned from import to the united states in the 1980s as a result , they were expensive units in comparison to other designs
