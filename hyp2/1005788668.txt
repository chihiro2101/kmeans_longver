the mechanics of the earthquake in the california earthquake of april 18 , 1906 , report of the state earthquake investigation commission , carnegie institution of washington , washington d.c the new class of faults , called transform faults , produce slip in the opposite direction from what one would surmise from the standard interpretation of an offset geological feature finally , transform faults form a tectonic plate boundary , while transcurrent faults do not this evidence helps to prove that new seafloor is being created at the mid-oceanic ridges and further supports the theory of plate tectonics wilson described six types of transform faults : growing length : in situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked , the transform fault itself will grow in length decreasing length faults : in rare cases , transform faults can shrink in length known as the st paul , romanche , chain , and ascension fracture zones , these areas have deep , easily identifiable transform faults and ridges transform faults are not limited to oceanic crust and spreading centers ; many of them are on continental margins the san andreas fault links the east pacific rise off the west coast of mexico ( gulf of california ) to the mendocino triple junction ( part of the juan de fuca plate ) off the coast of the northwestern united states , making it a ridge-to-transform-style fault the majority of the syncline is found in southland and the catlins in the island 's southeast , but a smaller section is also present in the tasman district in the island 's northwest
