1593–1594 ; , p toba 's erupted mass deposited an ash layer of about thick over the whole of south asia rampino and self believe that global cooling was already underway at the time of the eruption , but that the process was slow ; the youngest toba tuff '' may have provided the extra 'kick ' that caused the climate system to switch from warm to cold states '' but there is no consensus that the eruption directly generated the 1,000-year cold period seen in greenland or triggered the last glaciation we observed no obvious change in sediment composition or fe/ti ratio , suggesting that no thermally driven overturn of the water column occurred following the toba supereruption , passim ; , p 78–80 ; , pp furthermore , genetic analysis of alu sequences across the entire human genome has shown that the effective human population size was less than 26,000 at 1.2 million years ago ; possible explanations for the low population size of human ancestors may include repeated population bottlenecks or periodic replacement events from competing homo subspecies . genetic bottlenecks in other mammals a 2018 study by chad yost and colleagues of cores from lake malawi dating to the period of the youngest toba eruption showed no evidence of a volcanic winter , and they argue that there was no effect on african humans
