some early observations included the first spectroscopic detection of spectral line from the nuclei of ngc 1068 and messier 81 by edward fath ( published in 1909 ) , and the discovery of the jet in messier 87 by heber curtis ( published in 1918 ) '' his idea was initially accepted skeptically agn research encompasses observational surveys to find agn over broad ranges of luminosity and redshift , examination of the cosmic evolution and growth of black holes , studies of the physics of black hole accretion and the emission of electromagnetic radiation from agn , examination of the properties of jets and outflows of matter from agn , and the impact of black hole accretion and quasar activity on galaxy evolution for a long time it has been argued that an agn must be powered by accretion of mass onto massive black holes ( 10 6 to 10 10 times the solar mass ) thus agn-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole a large fraction of the agn 's radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc , but ( in a steady-state situation ) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband , most likely the infrared the most widely known of these is the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , but other theories exist the optical emission has a roughly power-law dependence on wavelength narrow optical emission lines this is always due to a jet it shows a spectrum characteristic of synchrotron radiation types of active galaxy if they are , they constitute the lowest-luminosity class of radio-quiet agn they show optical range nuclear continuum emission , narrow and occasionally broad emission lines , occasionally strong nuclear x-ray emission and sometimes a weak small-scale radio jet the host galaxies of quasars can be spirals , irregulars or ellipticals there is a correlation between the quasar 's luminosity and the mass of its host galaxy , in that the most luminous quasars inhabit the most massive galaxies ( ellipticals ) in the latter case , emission lines may become visible when the variable component is at a low level relativistic effects amplify both the luminosity of the jet and the amplitude of variability their other agn properties are heterogeneous by contrast , high-excitation objects ( narrow-line radio galaxies ) have emission-line spectra similar to those of seyfert 2s the small class of broad-line radio galaxies , which show relatively strong nuclear optical continuum emission probably includes some objects that are simply low-luminosity radio-loud quasars unification of agn species it must be large enough to obscure the broad-line region but not large enough to obscure the narrow-line region , which is seen in both classes of object if they do not have the scattering component of seyfert 2s they would be hard to detect except through their luminous narrow-line and hard x-ray emission these do not show strong nuclear emission lines—broad or narrow—they have optical continua which appear to be entirely jet-related , and their x-ray emission is also consistent with coming purely from a jet , with no heavily absorbed nuclear component in general . criticism of the radio-quiet unification intense , nuclear starbursts while studies of single agn show important deviations from the expectations of the unified model , results from statistical tests have been contradictory studying neighbour galaxies rather than the agn themselves first suggested the numbers of neighbours were larger for seyfert 2s than for seyfert 1s , in contradiction with the unified model understanding whether it is the same engine driving all seyfert 2s , the connection to radio-loud agn , the mechanisms of the variability of some agn that vary between the two types at very short time scales , and the connection of the agn type to small- and large-scale environment remain important issues to incorporate into any unified model of active galactic nuclei cosmological uses and evolution most luminous classes of agn ( radio-loud and radio-quiet ) seem to have been much more numerous in the early universe
