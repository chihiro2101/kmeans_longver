the division furrow does not protrude into the yolky region as those cells impede membrane formation and this causes the incomplete separation of cells in bilateria cleavage can be either holoblastic or meroblastic depending on the species drosophila melanogaster ( fruit fly ) hox gene use the 14 segments as pinpoints for specific types of cell differentiation and the histological developments that correspond to each cell type in regard to humans , the term embryo refers to the ball of dividing cells from the moment the zygote implants itself in the uterus wall until the end of the eighth week after conception evolutionary embryology is the expansion of comparative embryology by the ideas of charles darwin karl ernst von baer along with heinz christian pander , also proposed the germ layer theory of development which helped to explain how the embryo developed in progressive steps part of this explanation explored why embryos in many species often appear similar to one another in early developmental stages using his four principles 2-5 % of babies are born with an observable abnormality and medical embryology explores the different ways and stages that these abnormalities appear in when abnormalities appear due to outside contributors , these are disruptions common teratogens are alcohol , retinoic acid , ionizing radiation or hyperthermic stress vertebrate and invertebrate embryology for example , numerous invertebrate species release a larva before development is complete ; at the end of the larval period , an animal for the first time comes to resemble an adult similar to its parent or parents although invertebrate embryology is similar in some ways for different invertebrate animals , there are also countless variations after the 1950s , with the dna helical structure being unraveled and the increasing knowledge in the field of molecular biology , developmental biology emerged as a field of study which attempts to correlate the genes with morphological change , and so tries to determine which genes are responsible for each morphological change that takes place in an embryo , and how these genes are regulated
