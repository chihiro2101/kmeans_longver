a young girl began suffering migraines which led to sleep deprivation and depression this suggestion caused the young girl to fabricate memories of her father molesting her , which led to her being placed in foster care and her father being tried on charges of abuse most hypnotherapists and academics in this field of research work from the premise that hypnotic susceptibility ( or suggestibility ) is a factor in inducing useful hypnosis states john kappas ( 1925–2002 ) identified three different types of suggestibility in his lifetime that have improved hypnosis : emotional suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to inferred suggestions that affect emotions and restrict physical body responses ; usually associated with hypnoidal depth with this type of subject the operator must give logical explanations for every suggestion and must allow the subject to feel that he is doing the hypnotizing himself what has not been agreed on is whether suggestibility is : a permanent fixed detail of character or personality ; a genetic or chemical psychiatric tendency ; a precursor to or symptom of an activation of such a tendency ; a learned skill or acquired habit ; synonymous with the function of learning ; a neutral , unavoidable consequence of language acquisition and empathy ; a biased terminology provoking one to resist new externally introduced ideas or perspectives ; a mutual symbiotic relation to the other , such as the african conception of ubunthu or ubuntu ; related to the capacity of empathy and communication ; a matter of concordant personal taste between speaker / hypnotist and listener and listener 's like of / use for speaker 's ideas ; a skill or a flaw or something neutral and universal the data indicates that these are different constructs this indicates that hypnotic susceptibility scales are better measures of waking suggestibility than they are of hypnotizability the intrigue of differences in individual suggestibility even crops up in the early greek philosophers this is distinct from the culturally biased common parlance of the term '' suggestible '' both terms are often bound with undeserved negative social connotations not inherent in the word meanings themselves to be suggestible is not to be gullible a suggestion may direct the thoughts to notice a new concept , focus on a specific area within the world , offer new perspectives that later may influence action-choices , offer triggers for automatic behavior ( such as returning a smile ) , or indicate specific action types in hypnotherapy the portrayed realistic experience of the client 's requested outcome is suggested with flattery or urgency , as well as personalized to the client 's own motivations , drives , and tastes common experience of suggestions , given a fixed suggestion , what is the outcome ? ) clinical hypnosis : the study of clinical suggestion directed at the question : : : '' what is it that i can possibly say to this particular subject , in this specific context , to generate my goal of having them do xyz ? '' ( i.e non-state explanations of hypnotic responsiveness whilst this view does not dispute that hypnotized individuals truly experience the suggested effects , it asserts that the mechanism this takes place by has , in part , been '' socially constructed '' and does not , therefore , require any explanation involving any sort of an '' altered state of consciousness '' memory detail will be great for older children some younger children may need help recalling past events with the help of an adult gist extraction : although children are extremely likely to recall false memory when past events are similar to a current event , they will also recall false memory details that are seemingly unrelated to the event repeated questions : it has been shown that asking children the same question over and over again in an interview will often cause the child to reverse their first answer , especially in yes or no questions interviewer 's tone : children are extremely perceptive of people 's tones , especially in an interview situation peer interactions : children 's accounts of events can be greatly distorted by information from their peers repeating misinformation : repeating misinformation is simply when an interviewer gives a child incorrect details of an event common examples of suggestible behavior in everyday life include '' contagious yawning '' ( multiple people begin to yawn after observing a person yawning ) and the medical student syndrome ( a person begins to experience symptoms of an illness after reading or hearing about it )
