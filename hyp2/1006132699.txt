two negatives resolving to a positive there is n't no other way negative : is n't ( is not ) , no vs any assumption would be correct , and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out ; thereby rendering the sentence 's meaning ambiguous however , the statement '' i do n't completely disagree '' is a similar double negative to '' i do n't disagree '' but needs little or no clarification jones possesses basic competence at his tasks about the knight , '' he nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / in all his lyf unto no maner wight '' ( '' he never yet no vileness did n't say / in all his life to no manner of man '' ) i asked him what it was i 'm not hungry no more we ca n't not go to sleep ! the key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives double negatives such as i do n't want to know no more contrast with romance languages such as french in je ne veux pas savoir a sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives , such as those prescribed in the later examples , where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it the last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive double negatives continue to be spoken by those of vernacular english , such as those of appalachian english and african american vernacular english this shows that double negatives were present in colonial english , and thus presumably english as a whole , and were acceptable at that time in film and tv we do n't need no badges ! ( '' i did not know that he would be coming '' ) ek het geweet dat hy nie sou kom nie '' ) hy sal nie kom nie , want hy is siek ( '' it is not so difficult to learn afrikaans '' ) ek stem nie nié met jou saam nie ( '' i do n't not agree with you , '' i.e , i agree with you for example , compare the bavarian des hob i no nia ned g'hört ( '' this have i yet never not heard '' ) with the standard german '' das habe ich noch nie gehört '' a few examples would be : איך האב קיינמאל נישט געזאגט ( '' i never did n't say '' ) איך האב נישט קיין מורא פאר קיינעם ניט ( '' i have no fear of no one not '' ) it is common to add נישט ( '' not '' ) after the yiddish word גארנישט ( '' nothing '' ) , i.e איך האב גארנישט נישט געזאגט ( '' i have n't said nothing '' ) ne verb pas , ne verb plus , or ne verb jamais , as in the sentences je ne sais pas , il n ' y a plus de batterie , and on ne sait jamais in venetian , the double negation no these exemplify jespersen 's cycle other romance languages employ double negatives less regularly that practice is dying out for example , the sentence 'you ( pl in slavic languages , multiple negatives affirm each other in bulgarian , it is : никога не съм виждал никого никъде ( 'nikoga ne sam vishdal nikogo nikade ' ) , lit '' i do n't know nothing '' saying '' i saw nobody '' in polish ( widziałem nikogo ) instead of the more usual '' i did not see nobody '' ( nikogo nie widziałem ) might mean '' i saw an instance of nobody '' or '' i saw mr nobody '' but it would not have its plain english meaning in czech , like in many other languages , a standard double negative is used in sentences with a negative pronoun or negative conjunction , where the verb is also negated ( '' nikdo nepřišel '' '' nobody came '' , literally '' nobody did n't come '' ) jiří haller , v as with most synthetic satem languages double negative is mandatory in latvian and lithuanian double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in hungarian with negative pronouns : nincs semmim ( word for word : '' doesn't-exists nothing-of-mine '' , and translates literally as '' i do not have nothing '' ) means '' i do not have anything '' many languages , including all living germanic languages , french , welsh and some berber and arabic dialects , have gone through a process known as jespersen 's cycle , where an original negative particle is replaced by another , passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles ( e.g 452 van gelderen , elly 130 a similar development to a circumfix from double negation can be seen in non-indo-european languages , too : for example , in maltese , kiel '' he ate '' is negated as ma kielx '' he did not eat '' , where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ma- '' not '' and followed by the particle -x , which was originally a shortened form of xejn '' nothing '' - thus , '' he did n't eat nothing ''
