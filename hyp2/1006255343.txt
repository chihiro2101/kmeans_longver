a virtual particle does not precisely obey the energyâ€“momentum relation most of these have analogous effects in solid-state physics ; indeed , one can often gain a better intuitive understanding by examining these cases in particular , part of the appeal is that the outgoing legs of a feynman diagram can be associated with actual , on-shell particles for example , if the solid lines were to correspond to electrons interacting by means of the electromagnetic interaction , the dotted line would correspond to the exchange of a virtual photon however , in order to preserve quantum numbers , most simple diagrams involving fermion exchange are prohibited this implies the number of particles in an area of space is not a well-defined quantity but , like other quantum observables , is represented by a probability distribution since these particles do not have a permanent existence , they are called virtual particles or vacuum fluctuations of vacuum energy on the other hand , the casimir effect can be interpreted as the relativistic van der waals force this pair-creation amplitude was first calculated by julian schwinger in 1951 compared to actual particles
