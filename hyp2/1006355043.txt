over time , he bought several manors at congham , west acre and happisburgh , all in norfolk , and was granted a coat of arms , becoming a minor member of the gentry her father and grandfather had practised law in the norfolk area , and her sister audrey was married to thomas gawdy , a lawyer and justice of the court of king 's bench with links to the earl of arundel the other seven were daughters – winifred , dorothy , elizabeth , ursula , anna , margaret and ethelreda – although it is not known in which order the children were born . education and call to the bar the chapel itself is a white building with arches and large glass windows at the age of eight in 1560 , coke began studying at the norwich school little is known of his time at trinity , though he certainly studied rhetoric and dialectics under a program instituted in 1559 '' after leaving trinity college he travelled to london , where he became a member of clifford 's inn in 1571 students were educated through arguments and debates & nbsp ; – they would be given precedents and writs each day , discuss them at the dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions at the inner temple he began the second stage of his education , reading legal texts such as glanville 's treatises and taking part in moots polson , a biographer of coke , suggests that this was due to his knowledge of the law , which '' excited the benchers '' . practice as a barrister cromwell argued that denny was guilty of scandalum magnatum , slander against a peer of the realm , because his statement implied that cromwell himself was seditious or had seditious tendencies after the case was restarted , coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell 's support of people attacking the book of common prayer , and was not implying any deeper disloyalty the next year he was elected reader of lyon 's inn for three years , something surprising considering his young age and likely related to his conduct in lord cromwell 's case as well as defeating these direct attacks coke traveled to cardiff to answer a challenge by francis dacre , son of william dacre , 3rd baron dacre and uncle-in-law to the 4th duke 's three sons , philip howard and his two half-brothers , thomas howard , 1st earl of suffolk and lord william howard & nbsp ; – he proved that dacre 's evidence was false and had the case dismissed coke became involved in the now classic shelley 's case in 1581 , which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today ; the case also established coke 's reputation as an attorney and case reporter . solicitor general and speaker this created a vacancy among the law officers of the crown , and thanks to the influence of the cecil family , coke became solicitor general on 16 june 1592 the taxes were paramount ; subsidies collected in 1589 had been spent , and the war continued the idea of a calm , swift parliament foundered on the rocks of religious conflict morice was placed under house arrest , and seven members of parliament were later arrested , but the bills remained in parliament coke and cecil , the government 's two strongest defenders in parliament , made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills immediately afterwards , coke was summoned by the queen , who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty coke reacted by becoming even more dogmatic in his actions on behalf of the crown , and when devereux approached the queen on bacon 's behalf , she replied that even bacon 's uncle william cecil , 1st baron burghley lord burghley considered him the second best candidate , after coke in march 1599 devereux was sent to defeat the growing rebellion in ireland and was given command of 18,000 & nbsp ; men , but by november his army was reduced to 4,000 , the rest '' frittered away '' in exchange for '' conquering nothing '' in response , coke and cecil began a counter-plot in reaction , coke decided to bring charges of treason against devereux , saying that he had '' plotted and practised with the pope and king of spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of england & nbsp ; coke was reconfirmed as attorney general under james , and immediately found himself dealing with '' a series of treasons , whether real or imaginary '' the government alleged that on 11 june 1603 , raleigh had met with lord cobham , and they had agreed to bring lady arbella stuart ( a great great granddaughter of henry vii ) to the english throne , and to accept 600,000 & nbsp ; marks from the spanish government coke conducted the prosecution for the government – an easy one , since the conspirators had no legal representation – and through his speeches , '' blackened them in the eyes of the world '' levy , emergence of a free press , chicago : ivan r dee , 1985 , p the court of king 's bench argued that this was a lay matter , while the high commission claimed it fell under their jurisdiction this was a defeat for the common law , and in response coke spent the summer issuing writ of prohibition to again challenge bancroft and the high commission coke challenged this , saying '' the king in his own person can not adjudge any case , either criminal – as treason , felony etc , or betwixt party and party ; but this ought to be determined and adjudged in some court of justice , according to the law and custom of england '' coke further stated that '' the common law protecteth the king '' , to which james replied '' the king protecteth the law , and not the law the king ! the king maketh judges and bishops coke began reporting cases in the traditional manner , by copying out and repeating cases found in earlier law reports , such as those of edmund plowden after being called to the bar in 1578 he began attending court cases at westminster hall , and soon drew the attention of court officials – many early reports have notes that he was told '' by old plowden '' or '' by wray cj '' these were written down with the plea roll reference and the year in which coke recorded them , but later editions failed to include the plea roll reference and led to inaccuracies the fifth part , published in 1605 , is arranged similarly , as is the sixth , published in 1607 some academics have questioned the accuracy of the reports part one , the commentary upon littleton , was undoubtedly the most famous ; copies were exported to the united states early in the colonial era as with the reports , coke 's institutes became a standard textbook in the united states , and was recorded in the law libraries of harvard college in 1723 and brown university in 1770 ; john jay , john adams , theophilus parsons and thomas jefferson were all influenced by it the third institutes has been described as '' the first really adequate discussion of treason , a work which went far towards offering the remedy of a humanized common law to the injustices of trial procedures '' it is a book to be 'read in ' and lived with , rather than consulted , a monument to the uselessness of merely written knowledge unless it is internalised in a trained professional mind '' coke 's position meant that certainty of the law and intellectual beauty was the way to see if a law was just and correct , and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable during the legal and public campaigns against the writ of assistance and stamp act 1765 , bonham 's case was given as a justification for nullifying the legislation , and in the income tax case of 1895 , joseph hodges choate used coke 's argument that a tax upon the income of property is a tax on the property itself to have the supreme court of the united states declare the wilson–gorman tariff act unconstitutional the castle doctrine originates from coke 's statement in the third institutes that '' a man 's home is his castle – for where shall he be safe if it not be in his house ? '' , which also profoundly influenced the fourth amendment to the united states constitution ; the third amendment , on the other hand , was influenced by the petition of right he was eloquent , effective , forceful , and occasionally overbearing most early lawyers were not noted for their eloquence , with thomas elyot writing that '' they lacked elocution and pronunciation , two of the principal parts of rhetorike '' , and roger ascham saying that '' they do best when they cry loudest '' , describing a court case where an advocate was '' roaring like a bull '' bodet noting that his early career as a state prosecutor was one of '' arrogance and brutality ''
