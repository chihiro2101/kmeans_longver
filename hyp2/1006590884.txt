after bmw bought bramo in 1939 both projects were merged into the bmw 801 , learning from the problems encountered in both projects however this system proved almost impossible to operate properly with the bmw 139 ; early prototypes of the fw 190 demonstrated terrible cooling problems there was a considerable amount of wind tunnel work done on the engine and bmw-designed forward cowling ( incorporating the engine 's oil cooler ) at the luftfahrtforschungsanstalt ( lfa ) facility in v√∂lkenrode , leading to the conclusion it was possible to reduce drag equivalent to christopher ( 2013 ) , pp gunston ( 2006 ) , p the bmw 801c was developed for use in single- or multi-engined fighters and included a new hydraulic prop control and various changes intended to improve cooling , including cooling '' gills '' on the cowling behind the engine in place of the original slots christopher ( 2013 ) , p it was planned to use the f on all late-model fw 190 's , but the war ended before production started importance of continued development in mid-june 1945 , sir roy fedden 's team spoke to dr as just one result of the highest level of priority given to the successful 801 design 's further development , a number of attempts were made to use turbochargers on the bmw 801 series as well the bmw 801e was likewise modified to create the bmw 801q , delivering a superb 1,715 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,261 & nbsp ; kw ) at , power ratings no existing allied radial engine of a similar displacement could match as of 2011 , it is once again airworthy and located in seattle , washington , usa the sole surviving ju 388 , in the hands of the udvar-hazy center of the smithsonian , has a pair of complete bmw 801j turbocharged engines still in its nacelles the fan rotated at 1.72 times the crankshaft speed ( 3.17 times the propeller speed ) airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine outward and forward within the cowl 's frontmost inner area just behind the fan , flowing forward across the oil cooler core in a separate airflow path from the rearwards-direction flow that cooled the engine 's cylinders , just to provide cooling for the 801 's oil finally , by placing the oil cooler behind the fan , cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked this factory-supplied cowling also improved the simplicity of engine replacement in the field in more completely '' unitizing '' a bmw 801 radial engine , with as many of its auxiliary systems as possible being simultaneously replaceable with the engine itself , as opposed to opening or removing a '' separate '' cowling attached to the fuselage of the aircraft the motoranlage was the original form of the interchangeable kraftei , or '' power-egg '' , unitized powerplant installation concept used in many german wartime aircraft ; bmw 801 a , c , l ( b ) :1,560 ps ( 1,539 hp , 1,147 kw ) ; bmw 801 d-2 , q-2 , g-2 , ( h-2 ) :1,700 ps ( 1,677 hp , 1,250 kw ) ; bmw 801 e , s :2,000 ps ( 1,973 hp , 1,471 kw ) ; bmw 801 f :2,400 ps ( 2,367 hp , 1,765 kw ) , development halted by the end of the war blohm & voss bv 141 blohm & voss bv 144 dornier do 217 focke-wulf fw 190 focke-wulf fw 191 heinkel he 277 ( as designed for amerikabomber role ) junkers ju 88 junkers ju 188 junkers ju 288 ( as temporary fitment , in place of intended jumo 222 engines ) junkers ju 388 junkers ju 290 junkers ju 390 messerschmitt me 264 ( replacing original jumo 211 fitment )
