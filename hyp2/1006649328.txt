other memory types required constant power to retain data , such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops , williams tubes , and semiconductor memory ( static or dynamic ram ) embedded systems , such as an engine control computer for a car , must retain their instructions when power is removed prom improved on this design , allowing the chip to be written electrically by the end-user currently , the best-known form of both nv-ram and eeprom memory is flash memory as of june 2018 these alternatives have not yet become mainstream for example , ibm pc 's and successors beginning with the ibm pc at used nonvolatile bios memory , often called cmos ram or parameter ram , and this was a common solution in other early microcomputer systems like the original apple macintosh , which used a small amount of memory powered by a battery for storing basic setup information like the selected boot volume much larger battery backed memories are still used today as caches for high-speed databases that require a performance level newer nvram devices have not yet managed to meet this high power pulse , in effect , sucks the electrons through the insulator , returning it to the ground state the basis of flash memory is identical to eeprom , and differs largely in internal layout due to this crystal structure and how it is influenced , f-ram offers distinct properties from other nonvolatile memory options , including extremely high endurance ( exceeding 10 16 access cycles for 3.3 & nbsp ; v devices ) , ultra low power consumption ( since f-ram does not require a charge pump like other non-volatile memories ) , single-cycle write speeds , and gamma radiation tolerance only one mram chip has entered production to date : everspin technologies ' 4 mbit part , which is a first-generation mram that utilizes cross-point field induced writing intel and stmicroelectronics are now selling pram based devices to consumers , under the names 3d xpoint optane , and quantx millipede is , in essence , a punched card rendered using nanotechnology in order to dramatically increase areal density in theory the technology offers storage densities on the order of 1 tbit/in² ( ≈394 gbit/cm² ) , greater than even the best hard drive technologies currently in use ( perpendicular recording offers 636 gbit/in² ( ≈250.4 gbit/cm² ) as of dec however , slow read and write times for memories this large seem to limit this technology to hard drive replacements as opposed to high-speed ram-like uses , although to a very large degree the same is true of flash as well an alternative application of ( hafnium oxide based ) ferroelectrics is fe fet based memory , which utilises a ferroelectric between the gate and device of a field-effect transistor nova ( filesystem ) spin-transfer torque spintronics uefi
