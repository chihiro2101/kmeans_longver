this rna is complementary to the template 3′ → 5′ dna strand , with the exception that thymines ( t ) are replaced with uracils ( u ) in the rna rna polymerase i is responsible for transcription of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) genes , snrnas , snornas or long non-coding rnas ) rna polymerase iii transcribes 5s rrna , transfer rna ( trna ) genes , and some small non-coding rnas ( e.g while transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates mrna ( mrna ) that is ready for translation into protein , transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of rna ( pre-rna ) , which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature rna even though prerna molecules for both mrna and trna undergo splicing , the steps and machinery involved are different the processing of non-coding rna is described below ( non-coring rna maturation ) the m 7 g cap is then bound by cap binding complex heterodimer ( cbc20/cbc80 ) , which aids in mrna export to cytoplasm and also protect the rna from decapping extensive rna processing may be an evolution made possible by the nucleus of eukaryotes the pre-rrna is cleaved and modified ( 2′-o-methylation and pseudouridine formation ) at specific sites by approximately 150 different small nucleolus-restricted rna species , called snornas after being exported , it is then processed to mature mirnas in the cytoplasm by interaction with the endonuclease dicer , which also initiates the formation of the rna-induced silencing complex , composed of the argonaute protein specific exportin molecules are responsible for the export of a given rna type in some cases rnas are additionally transported to a specific part of the cytoplasm , such as a synapse ; they are then towed by motor proteins that bind through linker proteins to specific sequences ( called '' zipcodes '' ) on the rna every mrna consists of three parts : a 5′ untranslated region ( 5′utr ) , a protein-coding region or open reading frame ( orf ) , and a 3′ untranslated region ( 3′utr ) in prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription ( co-transcriptionally ) , often using a messenger rna that is still in the process of being created thumb each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mrna into a linear chain of amino acids many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins , for the immune system does not produce antibodies for certain protein structures regulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene the activity of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein post-translational modification including phosphorylated , acetylated , or glycosylated the nuclear membrane in eukaryotes allows further regulation of transcription factors by the duration of their presence in the nucleus , which is regulated by reversible changes in their structure and by binding of other proteins methylation of cytosine primarily occurs in dinucleotide sequences where a cytosine is followed by a guanine , a cpg site the number of cpg sites in the human genome is about 28 million methylation of cytosine in dna has a major role in regulating gene expression methylation of cpgs in a promoter region of a gene usually represses gene transcription while methylation of cpgs in the body of a gene increases expression . transcriptional regulation in learning and memory in a rat , contextual fear conditioning ( cfc ) is a painful learning experience . transcriptional regulation in cancer in breast cancer , transcriptional repression of brca1 may occur more frequently by over-expressed microrna-182 than by hypermethylation of the brca1 promoter ( see low expression of brca1 in breast and ovarian cancers ) by binding to specific sites within the 3′-utr , mirnas can decrease gene expression of various mrnas by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript mres are sequences to which mirnas bind these are prevalent motifs within 3′-utrs of these , 1,881 mirnas were in annotated human mirna loci estimate that > 45,000 mirna target sites within human mrna 3′utrs are conserved above background levels , and > 60 % of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to mirnas protein synthesis inhibitors include the antibiotic neomycin and the toxin ricin post-translational modifications ( ptms ) are covalent modifications to proteins these modifications are usually catalyzed by enzymes ptms are involved in transcriptional regulation : an important function of acetylation and methylation is histone tail modification , which alters how accessible dna is for transcription they can also be seen in the immune system , where glycosylation plays a key role one type of ptm can initiate another type of ptm , as can be seen in how ubiquitination tags proteins for degradation through proteolysis a sample of rna is separated on an agarose gel and hybridized to a radioactively labeled rna probe that is complementary to the target sequence perceived disadvantages of northern blotting are that large quantities of rna are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate , as it involves measuring band strength in an image of a gel reverse transcription first generates a dna template from the mrna ; this single-stranded template is called cdna they are generated by organizations such as the genomics institute of the novartis research foundation and the european bioinformatics institute these profiles indicate the level of dna expression ( and hence rna produced ) of a certain protein in a certain tissue , and are color-coded accordingly in the images located in the protein box on the right side of each wikipedia page the antibody can either be conjugated to a fluorophore or to horseradish peroxidase for imaging and/or quantification this is done by imaging using a fluorescence microscope it is very difficult to clone a gfp-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often can not be used to measure endogenous gene expression in addition to these biological tools , certain naturally observed configurations of dna ( genes , promoters , enhancers , repressors ) and the associated machinery itself are referred to as an expression system the following experimental techniques are used to measure gene expression and are listed in roughly chronological order , starting with the older , more established technologies many microbe microarrays database : microbial affymetrix data
