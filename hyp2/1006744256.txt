strictly speaking , a shaft which rotates with the wheel , being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it , is called an axle or axle shaft thus , transverse pairs of wheels in an independent suspension may be called an axle in some contexts in a live-axle suspension system , the axles serve to transmit driving torque to the wheel , as well as to maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body conversely , many front-wheel drive cars have a solid rear beam axle this is typical of the independent suspensions found on most newer cars and suvs , and on the front of many light trucks structural features and design straight axles are used on trains ( that is , locomotives and railway wagons ) , for the rear axles of commercial trucks , and on heavy duty off-road vehicles sae grade 41xx steel is commonly known as '' chrome-molybdenum steel '' ( or '' chrome-moly '' ) while sae grade 10xx steel is known as '' carbon steel '' a dead axle , also called a lazy axle , is not part of the drivetrain , but is instead free-rotating the rear axle of a front-wheel drive car is usually a dead axle lifting an axle also alleviates lateral scrubbing of the additional axle in very tight turns , allowing the vehicle to turn more readily lift axles were in use in the early 1940s soon hydraulics replaced the mechanical lift system one of the early manufacturers was zetterbergs , located in östervåla , sweden their brand was zeta-lyften full-floating axle shafts are retained by a flange bolted to the hub , while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut
