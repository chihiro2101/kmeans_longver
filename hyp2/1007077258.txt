it is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves if , as in fig the central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system the heterodyne technique is used for ( 1 ) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as ( 2 ) amplifying a weak input signal ( assuming use of an active mixer ) engineer edwin howard armstrong in 1918 this if is amplified and filtered , before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal , which is sent to the loudspeaker while optical heterodyne interferometry is usually done at a single point it is also possible to perform this widefield & nbsp ; 5 illustrates young 's interference experiment and lloyd 's mirror if white light is used in young 's experiment , the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits , surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity an amplitude splitting interferometer uses a partial reflector to divide the amplitude of the incident wave into separate beams which are separated and recombined other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include the michelson , twyman–green , laser unequal path , and linnik interferometer the reference flat is slightly beveled ( only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary ) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once , and the fringes can be adjusted so that they are localized in any desired plane as illustrated in fig the result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference ) as with the fizeau interferometer , the flats are slightly beveled as the ray passes through the paired flats , it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point a ' on the screen the sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats as seen in fig the other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror toxoplasma gondii unsporulated oocyst , differential interference contrast file : phase-contrast x-ray image of spider.jpg figure 26 as seen in figs angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry ( a/lci ) uses scattered light to measure the sizes of subcellular objects , including cell nuclei this allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements for example , it has been found that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous , the average cell nuclei size increases ( for an elementary discussion , see phase-contrast imaging x-ray imaging there are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging , all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations these include propagation-based phase contrast , talbot interferometry , moiré-based far-field interferometry , refraction-enhanced imaging , and x-ray interferometry
