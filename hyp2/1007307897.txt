to speak the truth , not hiding one 's heart from others ; to love one another and show it by the embrace ; to take no job where one has to lick the boss 's arse ; to learn from the maori side of the fence '' the increased numbers of residents and visitors , and the lack of order and regulation , led to growing concern from the sisters of compassion and wanganui district council , and opposition from local residents , particularly the local māori iwi , ngāti hau baxter returned to live in wellington , but in february 1972 was permitted to return to jerusalem provided that only 10 people would be allowed to live on the land at any one time a river boulder on the burial site was inscribed with his māori name hemi she set up the james k . allegations of sexual assault one letter in the collection revealed that baxter confided to a friend that he raped his wife , jacquie sturm , after she expressed low interest in sex paul millar , a baxter scholar and personal friend of sturm , who had been appointed as her literary executor after her death , cautioned against reading the letter as turning sturm into a victim : '' leaving apart how appalling this letter is – a betrayal on so many levels from the brutal act described , the lack of shame in the description , and the profound betrayal of trust – its publicity is once again putting jacquie in a subordinate position to baxter , a bit player in his narrative the problem is that his religious faith allowed him to regard his sexual failings—small and great—at a quizzical remove his biographer paul millar said : '' if , at times , baxter appears to evaluate new zealand society harshly , his judgements are always from the perspective of one intimately involved in the social process by contrast , john newton noted that at least some māori welcomed baxter 's engagement with their language and culture , and john weir regards his use as '' a genuine attempt at using a bicultural language in this country when no other pākehā was doing so '' yeats ;
