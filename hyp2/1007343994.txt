the ureters are tubular structures , approximately in adults , that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into the bladder here , they cross in front of the common iliac artery they then travel inward and forward , crossing the umbilical , inferior vesical , and middle rectal arteries . blood and lymphatic supply the lower third of the ureter , closest to the bladder , is supplied by branches from the internal iliac artery , mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries the middle part of the ureter drains into the right paracaval and interaortocaval nodes on the right , and the left paraaortic nodes on the left the plexus is in the adventitia below the epithelium sits the lamina propria the ureters develop from the ureteric buds , which are outpouchings from the mesonephric duct over time , the buds elongate , moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue , dilate , and divide into left and right ureters the urinary bladder forms from the urogenital sinus it is classically described that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become stuck : where the ureter meets the renal pelvis ; where the iliac blood vessels cross the ureters ; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder , however a retrospective case study , which is a primary source , of where stones lodged based on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood vessels cross most stones are compounds containing calcium such as calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate vesicoureteral reflux refers to the reflux of fluid from the bladder into the ureters one reason is most instances of vesicoureteral reflux improve by themselves if surgery is considered , it generally involves reattaching the ureters to a different spot on the bladder , and extending the part of the ureter that it is within the wall of the bladder , with the most common surgical option being cohen 's cross-trigonal reimplantation . anatomical and surgical abnormalities some congenital abnormalities can also result in narrowing or the ureters this may involve reinserting the ureters into a new place on the bladder ( reimplantion ) , or widening of the ureter when cancer is present , the most common symptom in an affected person is blood in the urine ; it may not cause symptoms , and a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal , except in late disease ureteral cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells lining the ureter , called transitional cell carcinoma , although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have changed due to chronic inflammation , such as due to stones or schistosomiasis investigations performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope , called cytology , as well as medical imaging by a ct urogram or ultrasound more invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy , which is the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters the structure specifically called the ureter is present in amniotes , meaning mammals , birds and reptiles the first radiology of the ureters first occurred via x-rays , although this was made more difficult by the thick abdomen , which the low power of the original x-rays was not able to penetrate enough to produce clear images things improved with the development by moses swick and leopold lichtwitz in the late 1920s of relatively nontoxic contrast media , with controversy surrounding publication as to who was the primary discoverer
