she published it in 1912 with further evidence in 1929 , hubble and milton l i '' , astronomy reports , 30 161–179 ( 1953 ) these cepheids are yellow bright giants and supergiants of spectral class f6 – k2 and their radii change by ( ~25 % for the longer-period hd 84810 ) millions of kilometers during a pulsation cycle classical cepheids are used to determine distances to galaxies within the local group and beyond , and are a means by which the hubble constant can be established type ii cepheids ( also termed population ii cepheids ) are population ii variable stars which pulsate with periods typically between 1 and 50 days anomalous cepheid variables have masses higher than type ii cepheids , rr lyrae variables , and our sun all these topics are actively debated in the literature delta cephei is also of particular importance as a calibrator of the cepheid period-luminosity relation since its distance is among the most precisely established for a cepheid , partly because it is a member of a star cluster and the availability of precise hubble space telescope/hipparcos parallaxes the more helium is heated , the more ionized it becomes at the dimmest part of a cepheid 's cycle , the ionized gas in the outer layers of the star is opaque , and so is heated by the star 's radiation , and due to the increased temperature , begins to expand the process then repeats classical cepheids include : eta aquilae , zeta geminorum , beta doradus , rt aurigae , polaris , as well as delta cephei
