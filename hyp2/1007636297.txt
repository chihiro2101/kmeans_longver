history of device configuration some early microcomputer peripheral devices required the end user physically to cut some wires and solder together others in order to make configuration changes ; such changes were intended to be largely permanent for the life of the hardware the msx system , released in 1983 , was designed to be plug and play from the ground up , and achieved this by a system of slots and subslots , where each had its own virtual address space , thus eliminating device addressing conflicts in its very source no jumpers or any manual configuration was required , and the independent address space for each slot allowed very cheap and commonplace chips to be used , alongside cheap glue logic the rom extensions hardware abstraction and offered standard apis as specified by ascii corporation amiga autoconfig and zorro bus the zorro architecture did not spread to general computing use outside of the amiga product line , but was eventually upgraded as zorro ii and zorro iii for the later iteration of amiga computers isa and pci self-configuration the pci plug and play ( autoconfiguration ) is based on the pci bios specification in 1990s , the pci bios specification is superseded by the acpi in 2000s legacy plug and play several completely automated computer interfaces are currently used , each of which requires no device configuration or other action on the part of the computer user , apart from software installation , for the self-configuring devices
