stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones , forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust ( continental arc volcanism , e.g japan , philippines , aleutian islands ) when the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano fractional crystallization of the magma there is considerable evidence for magma mixing just prior to many eruptions , including magnesium-rich olivine crystals in freshly erupted silicic lava that show no reaction rim whatever the precise mechanism , the pressure in the magma chamber increases to a critical point where the roof of the magma chamber fractures and the contents of the magma chamber are provided with a path to the surface through which to erupt subduction-zone stratovolcanoes , such as mount st pyroclastic flows are swift , avalanche-like , ground-sweeping , incandescent mixtures of hot volcanic debris , fine ash , fragmented lava and superheated gases that can travel at speeds in excess of villages within of the volcano were destroyed by pyroclastic flows , killing more than 2,000 people two decade volcanoes that erupted in 1991 provide examples of stratovolcano hazards also in 1991 , japan 's unzen volcano , located on the island of kyushu about east of nagasaki , awakened from its 200-year slumber to produce a new lava dome at its summit beginning in june , repeated collapse of this erupting dome generated ash flows that swept down the mountain 's slopes at speeds as high as unzen is one of more than 75 active volcanoes in japan ; an eruption in 1792 killed more than 15,000 peopleâ€”the worst volcanic disaster in the nation 's history although death toll is estimated between 13,000 and 26,000 remains , the exact number is still unclear apart from possibly affecting the climate , volcanic clouds from explosive eruptions also pose a serious hazard to aviation safety lava flows could melt down ice and glaciers that accumulated on the volcano 's crater and upper slopes , generating massive lahar flows
