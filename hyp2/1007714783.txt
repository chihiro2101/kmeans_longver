at one time , it was partly included in leucogenys it is mainly found in the rocky mountains today most vagrants that reach western europe seem to belong to the more northern and strongly migratory tundrius , only considered distinct since 1968 males weigh , while females weigh falco peregrinus brookei , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the mediterranean peregrine falcon or the maltese falcon it includes caucasicus and most specimens of the proposed race punicus , though others may be pelegrinoides ( barbary falcons ) , or perhaps the rare hybrids between these two which might occur around algeria it breeds in the arctic tundra of eurasia , from murmansk oblast to roughly yana and indigirka rivers , siberia the variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above , has little barring below , and has a head pattern like the saker falcon , but the ear region is white falco peregrinus ernesti , described by sharpe in 1894 , is found from the sunda islands to philippines and south to eastern new guinea and the nearby bismarck archipelago it is a dark form , resembling pealei in colour , but darker , especially on the tail it is similar to brookei in appearance , but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black the feet are proportionally large males have a rufous wash on crown , nape , ears , and back ; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown falco peregrinus pealei , described by ridgway in 1873 , is also known as peale 's falcon , and includes rudolfi it is found in the pacific northwest of north america , northwards from the puget sound along the british columbia coast ( including haida gwaii ) , along the gulf of alaska and the aleutian islands to the far eastern bering sea coast of russia , and may also occur on the kuril islands and the coasts of kamchatka the bill is very wide in india , the shaheen is reported from all states except uttar pradesh , mainly from rocky and hilly regions in sri lanka this species is found to favour the higher hills while the migrant calidus is more often seen along the coast , the nominate ( first-named ) subspecies , described by tunstall in 1771 , breeds over much of temperate eurasia between the tundra in the north and the pyrenees , mediterranean region and alpide belt in the south falco peregrinus tundrius , described by c.m it is found in the arctic tundra of north america to greenland , and migrates to wintering grounds in central and south america it is also paler than anatum ; most have a conspicuous white forehead and white in ear region , but the crown and '' moustache '' are very dark , unlike in calidus the air pressure from such a dive could possibly damage a bird 's lungs , but small bony tubercles on a falcon 's nostrils are theorized to guide the powerful airflow away from the nostrils , enabling the bird to breathe more easily while diving by reducing the change in air pressure endoparasites include plasmodium relictum ( usually not causing malaria in the peregrine falcon ) , strigeidae trematodes , serratospiculum amaculata ( nematode ) , and tapeworms the peregrine falcon takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in north america , with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon , including nearly 100 shorebirds nocturnal migrants taken by peregrines include species as diverse as yellow-billed cuckoo , black-necked grebe , virginia rail , and common quail the peregrine requires open space in order to hunt , and therefore often hunts over open water , marshes , valleys , fields , and tundra , searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air '' falcon attack : how peregrine falcons maneuver at nearly 225 mph '' , fiona mcmillan , 13 april 2018 , forbes the peregrine falcon is sexually mature at one to three years of age , but in larger populations they breed after two to three years of age during the breeding season , the peregrine falcon is territorial ; nesting pairs are usually more than apart , and often much farther , even in areas with large numbers of pairs the distance between nests ensures sufficient food supply for pairs and their chicks before the demise of most european peregrines , a large population of peregrines in central and western europe used the disused nests of other large birds in many parts of its range , peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges ; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations the pair defends the chosen nest site against other peregrines , and often against ravens , herons , and gulls , and if ground-nesting , also such mammals as foxes , wolverines , felids , bears , wolves , and mountain lions both nests and ( less frequently ) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles , large owls , or gyrfalcons they are incubated for 29 to 33 days , mainly by the female , with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day , but only the female incubating them at night the peregrine falcon is a highly admired falconry bird , and has been used in falconry for more than 3,000 years , beginning with nomads in central asia the peregrine falcon has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ( '' waiting on '' ) for game to be flushed , and then performing an effective and exciting high-speed diving stoop to take the quarry this size range , evolved to fit various environments and prey species , is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies , approximately five to one ( approximately 1500 & nbsp ; g to 300 & nbsp ; g ) the females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species , pheasant , and grouse the successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with the peregrine fund and state and federal agencies – through a technique called hacking the development of captive breeding methods has led to peregrines being commercially available for falconry use , thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry with thinner shells , fewer falcon eggs survived until hatching these pesticides caused falcon prey to also have thinner eggshells ( one example of prey being the black petrels ) following the ban of organochlorine pesticides , the reproductive success of peregrines increased in scotland in terms of territory occupancy and breeding success , although spatial variation in recovery rates indicate that in some areas peregrines were also impacted by other factors such as persecution in canada , where peregrines were identified as endangered in 1978 ( in the yukon territory of northern canada that year , only a single breeding pair was identified ) , the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada declared the species no longer at risk in december 2017 native americans of the mississippian culture ( c 800–1500 ) used the peregrine , along with several other birds of prey , in imagery as a symbol of '' aerial ( celestial ) power '' and buried men of high status in costumes associating to the ferocity of raptorial birds idaho state quarter features a peregrine falcon baker , the peregrine by j admirers of the book include robert macfarlane , landmarks , robert macfarlane , hamish hamilton , london , 2015 , chapter 5 mark cocker , who regards the book as '' one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century '' birds britannica , mark cocker & richard mabey
