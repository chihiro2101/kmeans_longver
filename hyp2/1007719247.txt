every user on the network has a unique xmpp address , called jid ( for historical reasons , xmpp addresses are often called jabber ids ) each resource may have specified a numerical value called priority the highest priority is the one with largest numerical value jids without a username part are also valid , and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server a resource remains optional for these jids as well xmpp applications beyond im include : chat rooms , network management , content syndication , collaboration tools , file sharing , gaming , remote systems control and monitoring , geolocation , middleware and cloud computing , voip , and identity services along with authentication and in-transit data protection , xmpp can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or message-oriented middleware ( mom ) protocol this xep is currently deferred in-band binary data transfer is limited xmpp servers can be isolated ( e.g , on a company intranet ) , and secure authentication ( sasl ) and point-to-point encryption ( tls ) have been built into the core xmpp specifications , as well as off-the-record messaging ( otr ) is an extension of xmpp enabling encryption of messages and data . connecting to other protocols such server-to-server gateways are offered by several enterprise im software products , including : ibm sametime '' lotus sametime 7.5 interoperates with aim , google talk '' , eweek , december 6 , 2006 eweek.com '' lotus ships gateway to integrate im with aol , yahoo , google '' , network world , december 6 , 2006 networkworld.com skype for business server ( formerly named microsoft lync server and microsoft office communications server – ocs ) '' unified communications : uniting communication across different networks '' , microsoft press release , october 1 , 2009 microsoft.com these implementations are provided under a variety of software licenses xmpp is also used in deployments of non-im services , including smart grid systems such as demand response applications , message-oriented middleware , and as a replacement for sms to provide text messaging on many smartphone clients in may 2013 , google announced xmpp compatibility would be dropped from google talk for server-to-server federation , although it would retain client-to-server support however , in march 2008 , this service was discontinued the early jabber protocol , as developed in 1999 and 2000 , formed the basis for xmpp as published in rfc 3920 and rfc 3921 in october 2004 ( the primary changes during formalization by the ietf 's xmpp working group were the addition of tls for channel encryption and sasl for authentication ) in 2015 , rfc 6122 was superseded by rfc 7622 in january 2010 , the service migrated to the proprietary m-link server software produced by isode ltd the xmpp standards foundation ( xsf ) develops and publishes extensions to xmpp through a standards process centered on xmpp extension protocols ( xeps , previously known as jabber enhancement proposals - jeps ) the following extensions are in especially wide use : data forms service discovery multi-user chat publish-subscribe and personal eventing protocol xhtml-im file transfer entity capabilities http binding jingle for voice and video the ietf xmpp working group has produced a series of request for comments ( rfc ) documents : rfc 3920 ( superseded by rfc 6120 ) rfc 3921 ( superseded by rfc 6121 ) rfc 3922 rfc 3923 rfc 4622 ( superseded by rfc 5122 ) rfc 4854 rfc 4979 rfc 6122 ( superseded by rfc 7622 ) the most important and most widely implemented of these specifications are : rfc 6120 , extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) : core , which describes client–server messaging using two open-ended xml streams
