thus , it was believed that most subsonic aircraft would become obsolete for passenger travel and would be eventually converted to freighters as a result , airline manufacturers opted for a wider fuselage rather than a taller one ( the 747 , and eventually the dc-10 and l-1011 ) by adding a second aisle , the wider aircraft could accommodate as many as 10 seats across , but could also be easily converted to a freighter and carry two eight-by-eight freight pallets abreast the wide-body age began in 1970 with the entry into service of the first wide-body airliner , the four-engined , partial double-deck boeing 747 '' the boeing 747 '' , u.s centennial of flight commission retrieved : 30 april 2006 in the '' jumbo '' category , the capacity of the boeing 747 was not surpassed until october 2007 , when the airbus a380 entered commercial service with the nickname '' superjumbo '' although wide-body aircraft have larger frontal areas ( and thus greater form drag ) than narrow-body aircraft of similar capacity , they have several advantages over their narrow-body counterparts , such as : a larger cabin space for passengers , giving a more open feeling a lower ratio of surface area to volume , and thus lower drag per passenger or cargo volume the boeing 777 twinjet features the most powerful jet engine , the general electric ge90 further information can be found under external links wake turbulence and separation airspace , '' super '' new military weapons are tested aboard wide-bodies , as in the laser weapons testing on the boeing yal-1 other wide-body aircraft are used as flying research stations , such as the joint germanâ€“u.s stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia )
