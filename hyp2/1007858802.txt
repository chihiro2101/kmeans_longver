in the theories postulated by ferdinand lot and roger sherman loomis , lancelot is related to llenlleog ( llenlleawc ) , an irishman in culhwch and olwen ( which associates him with the '' headland of gan ( i ) on '' ) , and the welsh hero llwch llawwynnauc ( most likely a version of the euhemerism irish deity lugh lonbemnech , with '' llwch '' meaning '' lake '' in welsh ) , possibly via a now-forgotten epithet such as lamhcalad , bruce , the arthurian name dictionary , p according to more recent scholars , such as norma lorre goodrich , the name , if not just an invention of the 12th-century french poet chrétien de troyes , may have been derived from geoffrey of monmouth 's character anguselaus , probably a latinised name of unguist , the name of a son of the 6th-century picts king forgus ; when translated from geoffrey 's latin into old french , it would became anselaus other 6th-century figures proposed in modern times as candidates for the prototype of lancelot include the early french saint fraimbault de lassay ; wlanca , a son-in-law of the anglo-saxon king ælle of sussex ; maelgwn , king of gwynedd ; and llaennog ( llaenauc ) , father of gwallog , king of elmet the theft of an infant by a water fairy , the appearance of the hero at a tournament on three consecutive days in three different disguises , and the rescue of a queen or princess from an otherworld prison are all features of a well-known and widespread tale , variants of which are found in numerous examples collected by theodore hersart de la villemarqué in his barzaz breiz , by emmanuel cosquin in his contes lorrains , and by john francis campbell in his tales of the west highlands goulven péron , '' la légende de lancelot du lac en anjou '' it is also chrétien who first gives lancelot the name lancelot du lac ( lancelot of the lake ) , william farina , chretien de troyes and the dawn of arthurian romance ( 2010 ) in the words of matilda bruckner , '' what existed before chrétien remains uncertain , but there is no doubt that his version became the starting point for all subsequent tales of lancelot as the knight whose extraordinary prowess is inextricably
