three current exchange systems thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them two tubes have a liquid flowing in the same direction at the input end , there is a large temperature difference of 40 & nbsp ; °c and much heat transfer ; at the output end , there is a very small temperature difference ( both are at the same temperature of 40 & nbsp ; °c or close to it ) , and very little heat transfer if any at all at the cold end—the water exit from the top pipe , because the cold water entering the bottom pipe is still cold at 20 & nbsp ; °c , it can extract the last of the heat from the now-cooled hot water in the top pipe , bringing its temperature down nearly to the level of the cold input fluid ( 21 & nbsp ; °c ) conditions for higher transfer results this is in keeping with the second law of thermodynamics countercurrent exchange in biological systems image : circulus arteriosus schaf.jpg right thumb 120px rete mirabile rm countercurrent exchange in biological systems occurred following the discovery of countercurrent multiplication systems by werner kuhn the buffer liquid between the two tubes is at a gradually rising concentration , always a bit over the incoming fluid , in this example reaching 1200 & nbsp ; mg/l thus when opposite the 1000 & nbsp ; mg/l in the buffer liquid , the concentration in the tube is 800 and only 200 & nbsp ; mg/l are needed to be pumped out in effect , this can be seen as a gradually multiplying effect—hence the name of the phenomena : a 'countercurrent multiplier ' or the mechanism : countercurrent multiplication , but in current engineering terms , countercurrent multiplication is any process where only slight pumping is needed , due to the constant small difference of concentration or heat along the process , gradually raising to its maximum beginning with the afferent arteriole , a blood vessel leading to the glomerulus , filtered blood is passed to the nephrons in the bowman 's capsule which surrounds the glomerulus proximal convoluted tubule : it then may reabsorb urea in the thick descending limb dopamin inhibits the secretion from the thick descending limb , and angiotensin ii catalyzes it loop of henle descending : the liquid passes from the thin descending limb to the thick ascending limb water is constantly released via osmosis : for example , the liquid at one section inside the thin descending limb is at 400 mosm while outside it is 401 the repeated concentration by secretion of calcium and salt ions is inhibited by thiazides and catalyzed by aantidiuretic hormone and aldosterone collecting duct : the collecting duct receives liquid between 100 mosm if no re-absorption is done , to 300 or above if re-absorption was used atrial natriuretic peptide and urodilatin inhibit water salt and calcium secretion from the collecting duct , while antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone catalyze it according to a book on jewish scientists under the reich kuhn theorized and studied this mechanism already in the early 1940s ( journal of the american society of nephrology website ) and confirmed by laboratory findings in 1958 by professor carl w gottschalk points to the heated debate prior to the acceptance of the theory of the countercurrent multiplier action of the kidney homer smith , a considerable contemporary authority on renal physiology , opposed the model countercurrent concentration for 8 years , until conceding ground in 1959 smith , homer w , the fate of sodium and water in the renal tubules , bull new york academy of medicine 35:293–316 , 1959 ever since , many similar mechanisms have been found in biologic systems , the most notable of these : the rete mirabile in fish countercurrent exchange of heat in organisms sea and desert birds have been found to have a salt gland near the nostrils which concentrates brine , later to be '' sneezed '' out to the sea , in effect allowing these birds to drink seawater without the need to find freshwater resources the salt secreting gland has been found in seabirds like pelicans , petrels , albatrosses , gulls , and terns although the fluid in the tubules is with a higher concentration of salt than the blood , the flow is arranged in a countercurrent exchange , so that the blood with a high concentration of salt enters the system close to where the gland tubules exit and connect to the main canal distillation of chemicals such as in petroleum refining is done in towers or columns with perforated trays image : coflore acx.png thumb left 120px counter flow in liquid-liquid extraction liquid-liquid extraction ( also called 'solvent extraction ' or 'partitioning ' ) is a common method for extracting a substance from one liquid into another liquid at a different 'phase ' ( such as '' slurry '' ) the nickel and cobalt in the slurry are removed from it almost completely using a ccd system exchanging the cobalt and nickel with flash steam heated water
