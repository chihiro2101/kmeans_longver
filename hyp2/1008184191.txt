the shorter preganglionic neurons originate in the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at t1 to l2~l3 , and travel to a ganglion , often one of the paravertebral ganglia , where they synapse with a postganglionic neuron at the synapses within the ganglia , preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine , a neurotransmitter that activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons within this endocrine gland , pre-ganglionic neurons synapse with chromaffin cells , triggering the release of two transmitters : a small proportion of norepinephrine , and more substantially , epinephrine the message is then carried to the final destination a notable exception to the routes mentioned above is the sympathetic innervation of the suprarenal ( adrenal ) medulla in the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system , these synapses are made at sites called ganglia for example , the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate heart rate ; widen bronchial passages ; decrease motility ( movement ) of the large intestine ; constrict blood vessels ; increase peristalsis in the oesophagus ; cause pupillary dilation , piloerection ( goose bumps ) and perspiration ( sweating ) ; and raise blood pressure this is because of a proportional increase in the presence of β 2 adrenergic receptors rather than α 1 receptors an alternative explanation is that the primary ( and direct ) effect of sympathetic stimulation on coronary arteries is vasoconstriction followed by a secondary vasodilation caused by the release of vasodilatory metabolites due to the sympathetically increased cardiac inotropy and heart rate fibers from the sns innervate tissues in almost every organ system , providing at least some regulation of functions as diverse as pupil diameter , gut motility , and urinary system output and function , & agur , a.m baltimore : lippincott williams & wilkins general visceral afferent sensations are mostly unconscious visceral motor reflex sensations from hollow organs and glands that are transmitted to the cns reaction to stress—as in the flight-or-fight response—is thought to counteract the parasympathetic system , which generally works to promote maintenance of the body at rest winslow applied the term specifically to nerves
