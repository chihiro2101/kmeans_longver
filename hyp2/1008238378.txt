image : theodore roosevelt on broken glass.jpg thumb this deteriorated dry plate portrait of theodore roosevelt is similar to a wet plate image but has substantial differences one collodion process , the tintype , was in limited use for casual portraiture by some itinerant and amusement park photographers as late as the 1930s , and the wet plate collodion process was still in use in the printing industry in the 1960s for line and tone work ( mostly printed material involving black type against a white background ) since it was much cheaper than gelatin film in large volumes fine art photographers use the process and its handcrafted individuality for gallery showings and personal work this was an improvement over the calotype process , discovered by henry fox talbot , which relied on paper negatives , and the daguerreotype , which produced a one-of-a-kind positive image and could not be replicated the wet collodion process had a major disadvantage this gave the photographer no more than about 10-15 minutes to complete everything warm colours appear dark , cool colours uniformly light evening news ( sydney , nsw : 1869 - 1931 ) , p the mansion is now part of the sydney church of england grammar school ( commonly known as shore or shore school ) two were 160 x 96.5 cm ( 5.1 ft x 3.08 ft ) and formed a panorama of sydney harbour from garden island to miller â€™ s point a large number of methods were tried , though none was ever found to be truly practical and consistent in operation well-known scientists such as joseph sidebotham , richard kennett , major russell and frederick charles luther wratten attempted , but never met with good results they suggested that sensitive silver salts be formed in a liquid collodion , rather than being precipitated , in-situ , on the surface of a plate a light-sensitive plate could then be prepared by simply flowing this emulsion across the surface of a glass plate ; no silver nitrate bath was required shortly later , silver iodide and silver bromide emulsions were produced :13 & nbsp ; grams of zinc bromide are dissolved in 29.6 ml of alcohol this is then poured into the other half of the collodion ; the bromine collodion dropped in , slowly , while stirring it is left to ripen for 10 to 20 hours , until it attains a creamy consistency after washing , it is redissolved in a mixture of ether and alcohol and is then ready for use : emulsions created in this manner could be used wet , but they were often coated on the plate and preserved in similar ways to the dry process an example formula follows : :part a : pyrogallic acid 96 g , alcohol 1 oz
