at the end of the 1480s , manutius published two works addressed to his two pupils and their mother , caterina pico—both works were published in venice by baptista de tortis : musarum panagyris with its epistola catherinae piae ( march/may 1487 to march 1491 ) and the paraenesis ( 1490 ) the aldine press published this newly expanded collection of proverbs , adagia , in 1508 with the aldine press 's increasing popularity , people would come to visit the shop , interrupting manutius 's work venice printer john speyer produced greek passages but required the minimal greek letters to be left blank and later filled in by hand to preserve ancient greek literature , the aldine press commissioned a typeface based on classical greek manuscripts so that readers could experience the original greek text more authentically latin and italian classics manutius did not hold the same power of innovation over latin classics as with greek classics because publication of these works started 30 years before his time '' the press printed first editions of poliziano collected works , pietro bembo asolani , francesco colonna 's hypnerotomachia poliphili , and dante 's divine comedy the international honor society for library and information science , beta phi mu , uses the dolphin and anchor as its insignia manutius described his new format of books as '' libelli portatiles in formam enchiridii '' ( '' portable small books in the form of a manual '' ) books : a living history los angeles : j in the new aldine studies , harry george fletcher iii , pierpont morgan library 's curator for printed books and bindings , writes that manutius intended '' to make available in type a face comfortable for its readers '' with the cursive typeface manutius commissioned the punchcutter francesco griffo of bologna to create the new typeface other scholars believe the first greek typeface was derived from the handwriting of immanuel rhusotas , another scribe during the time of manutius manutius and griffo 's original typeface is the first known model of italic type and was used by manutius until 1501 a falling out between manutius and griffo brought griffo to leave and supply other publishers with the italic type originally commissioned by the aldine press '' pope alexander vi in 1502 and pope julius ii in 1514 granted manutius printing privileges from the papacy illuminated manuscripts and aldine prefaces these woodcuts soon came to venice and were viewed as part of the '' new humanist manuscript '' the woodcut images '' included aspects of both continuity and discontinuity that involved the activity of manutius , who was called upon to wholly explicate the new potential of the printed book and deal with the crisis of the illumination prefatory letters , popular in first editions of latin works years before , were also common for aldine editions in 1505 , manutius married maria , the daughter of andrea torresani of asola this suspicious activity led the guards to arrest manutius manutius knew the marquis of mantua , francesco gonzaga , and wrote letters to him to explain the situation , but it took six days until manutius 's imprisonment was brought to gonzaga 's attention he died the next month , 6 february , and '' with his death the importance of italy as a seminal and dynamic force in printing came to an end the publishing symbol and motto were never wholly abandoned by the aldine press until the expiration of their firm in its third generation of operation by aldus manutius the younger on manutius , paul f '' the palazzo dei pio chapel in carpi has a painted mural that includes aldus manutius along with alberto and leonello pio in bassiano , manutius 's birthplace , a monument was erected to commemorate the 450th year since manutius 's death '' the quality and popularity of manutius 's work made it more expensive in the 20th century than others published around the same time the aldus corporation , a software company founded in seattle in 1985 known for pagemaker and freehand , was named after manutius and used his profile as part of their company logo greek editions published during manutius 's
