454,138 for “ improvements in telephone-receivers…which shall be light enough to be carried while in use on the head of the operator he offered it to the us navy for testing , and they promptly ordered 100 from baldwin these early headphones used moving iron speaker , with either single-ended or balanced armatures the audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet , exerting a varying force on the diaphragm , causing it to vibrate , creating sound waves in 1958 , john c cordless headphones are not connected to their source by a cable these are powered receiver systems , of which the headphone is only a component the larger 6.35 & nbsp ; mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment adapters are available for converting between 6.35 & nbsp ; mm and 3.5 & nbsp ; mm devices applications for audiometric testing in recent years , impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered cmos-based portable electronics the impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations , but produce less volume for a given output level in contrast , modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance , enabling lower-impedance headphones as the output voltage ( but not power ) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones , db/mw is often more useful if converted into db/v using ohm 's law : : \mathrm alternatively , online calculators can be used in contrast , the american occupational safety and health administration recommends an average spl of no more than 85 & nbsp ; db ( a ) to avoid long-term hearing loss , while the european union standard en 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85 & nbsp ; db ( a ) include a warning , with an absolute maximum volume ( defined using 40–4,000 & nbsp ; hz noise ) of no more than 100 & nbsp ; db to avoid accidental hearing damage headphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability these are commonly used by drummers in recording both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups : open-back headphones have the back of the earcups open they provide hardly any acoustic isolation and leave room for ambient noise to seep in ; users may turn up the volume dangerously high to compensate , at the risk of causing hearing loss since the early days of the transistor radio , earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices they are sold at times with foam or rubber pads for comfort thumb in-ear headphones , also known as in-ear monitors ( iems ) or canalphones , are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself iems are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by audio engineers and musicians as well as audiophiles the outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials , such as plastic , aluminum , ceramic and other metal alloys . mixed fitting pivoting earphones this type combines advantages of earbuds and in-ear headphones – depending on the environment and requirements of the user , they provide passive noise reduction for quality mode ( conversation or active music listening ) or they give control over the sound environment around user in comfort mode ( stand by or background voice/music listening ) a headset is a headphone combined with a microphone among applications for headsets , besides telephone use , are aviation , theatre or television studio intercom systems , and console or pc gaming most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone , mute function and switching between headset and handset the headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones , both circumaural and supra aural active noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone , amplifier , and speaker to pick up , amplify , and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form ; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source , which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone headphones use various types of transducer to convert electrical signals to sound thumb the loudspeaker , more commonly referred to as a '' dynamic '' driver is the most common type used in headphones it consists of a stationary magnet element affixed to the frame of the headphone , which sets up a static magnetic field thumb electrostatic drivers consist of a thin , electrically charged diaphragm , typically a coated pet film membrane , suspended between two perforated metal plates ( electrodes ) the high-frequency response means that the low-midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band , which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers they do not need to deliver significant electric current , which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon when these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver , headphones can be produced that are recognised by the japan audio society as worthy of joining the hi res audio program us patents 8,559,660 b2 in 2013 a carbon nanotube thin-yarn earphone based on the thermoacoustic mechanism was demonstrated by a research group in tsinghua university the as-produced cnt thin yarn earphone has a working element called cnt thin yarn thermoacoustic chip this is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed , or for people who are deaf for reasons that do n't affect the nervous apparatus of hearing high-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20 & nbsp ; hz within 3 & nbsp ; db it is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones , to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction , by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels united states department of labor extended periods of exposure to high sound pressure levels created by headphones at high volume settings may be damaging to hearing ; nearly 50 % of teenagers and young adults ( 12 to 35 years old ) in middle and high income countries listen to unsafe levels of sound on their personal audio devices and smartphones this has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of the efficiency of the headphones ; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency , high-impedance equipment , while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones a finnish study airo , erkko ; j & nbsp ; 82 , 885–894 . occupational health and safety hearing risk from headphones ' use also applies to workers who must wear electronic or communication headsets as part of their daily job ( i.e
