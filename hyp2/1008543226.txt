plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes , which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules ) , bios scientific publishers ltd proplastids and young chloroplasts commonly divide by binary fission , but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity plant proplastids ( undifferentiated plastids ) may differentiate into several forms , depending upon which function they perform in the cell etioplasts are the precursors of chloroplasts chromoplasts : coloured plastids for pigment synthesis and storage gerontoplasts : control the dismantling of the photosynthetic apparatus during plant senescence leucoplasts : colourless plastids for terpene synthesis ; leucoplasts sometimes differentiate into more specialized plastids : amyloplasts : for starch storage and detecting gravity ( for geotropism ) elaioplasts : for storing fat proteinoplasts : for storing and modifying protein tannosomes : for synthesizing and producing tannins and polyphenols depending on their morphology and function , plastids have the ability to differentiate , or redifferentiate , between these and other forms plastid types in algae and protists include : chloroplasts : found in the green algae and other organisms muroplasts : also known as cyanoplasts or cyanelles , the chloroplasts of glaucophyte algae are similar to plant chloroplasts , except that they have a peptidoglycan cell wall that is similar to that of prokaryote their function differs from the leucoplasts of plants apicoplast : the non-photosynthetic plastids of apicomplexa derived from secondary endosymbiosis the plastid of photosynthetic paulinella species is often referred to as the 'cyanelle ' or chromatophore , and is used in photosynthesis ; it had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90â€“140 million years ago , and is the only other known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria etioplasts , amyloplasts and chromoplasts are plant-specific and do not occur in algae plastids in algae and hornworts may also differ from plant plastids in that they contain pyrenoids . dna damage and repair as an example , in chloroplasts of the moss physcomitrella patens , a protein employed in dna mismatch repair ( msh1 ) interacts with proteins employed in recombinational repair ( reca and recg ) to maintain plastid genome stability the plastids differ both in their pigmentation and in their ultrastructure
