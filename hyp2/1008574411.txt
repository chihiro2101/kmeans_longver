good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency , and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air if done well , many of the other problems of woofer design ( for instance , linear excursion requirements ) are reduced normally the crossover and speaker system , including the woofer , are expected to convert the electrical signal supplied by the amplifier to an acoustic signal of identical waveform without other interaction between the amplifier and speakers , although sometimes the amplifier and speakers are designed together with the speakers supplying distortion-correcting negative feedback to the amplifier there are many challenges in woofer design and manufacture problems include damping the cone cleanly without audible distortion so that it does not continue to move , causing ringing , when the instantaneous input signal falls to zero each cycle , and managing high excursions ( usually required to reproduce loud sounds ) with low distortion thuras of bell laboratories in 1932 in 1965 , sennheiser electronics introduced the philharmonic sound system , which used electronics to overcome some of the problems ordinary woofer subsystems confront they added a motion sensor to the woofer , and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier digital filtering crossover and equalization materials like paper ( including coated paper cones ) and various polymers will generally ring less than metal diaphragms , but can be heavier and not as stiff since the voice coil gap is quite narrow ( clearances are typically in the low thousandths of an inch ) , rigidity is important to prevent rubbing of the voice coil against the magnet structure in the gap and also avoid extraneous motions woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes : applications requiring high output , amplifier overload conditions , unusual signals ( i.e there are three types of power handling in loudspeaker drivers , including woofers : thermal ( heat ) , electrical ( both covered above ) , and mechanical thermal power handling limits may be reached when fairly high power levels are fed to a woofer for too long , even if not exceeding mechanical limits at any time woofers designed for public address system ( pa ) and instrument amplifier applications are similar in makeup to home audio woofers , except that they are usually designed more ruggedly
