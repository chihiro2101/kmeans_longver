this region is the black hole 's boundary , in effect l- susskind and j lindesay , '' an introduction to black holes information and the string theory revolution , world scientific ( 2005 ) hawking 's insight was based on a phenomenon of quantum physics known as virtual particles , and their behaviour near the event horizon an alternative view of the process is that vacuum fluctuations cause a particleâ€“antiparticle pair to appear close to the event horizon of a black hole an important difference between the black hole radiation as computed by hawking and thermal radiation emitted from a black body is that the latter is statistical in nature , and only its average satisfies what is known as planck 's law of black-body radiation , while the former fits the data better a black hole of ( about the mass of the moon , or about across ) would be in equilibrium at 2.7 & nbsp ; k , absorbing as much radiation as it emits a schwarzschild black hole has a metric : : \left ( \mathrm grain explain how the hawking radiation could be detected at colliders
