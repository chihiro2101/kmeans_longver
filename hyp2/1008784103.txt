light refracted or reflected causes patterns called caustics , usually visible as concentrated patches of light on nearby surfaces diffuse interreflection was first modeled using radiosity solutions rendering ( 2nd pass ) as long as a ray does not intersect another object , the light source is used to calculate the direct illumination calculating radiance using the photon map in order to calculate surface radiance at an intersection point , one of the cached photon maps is used this is true ; however , the algorithm used to compute radiance does not depend on irradiance estimates during the photon mapping process , when a photon strikes a surface , in addition to the usual operations performed , a shadow photon is emitted in the same direction the original photon came from that goes all the way through the object essentially , the filter gives weight to photons ' contributions to radiance depending on how far they are from ray-surface intersections this can produce sharper images image space photon mapping achieves real-time performance by computing the first and last scattering using a gpu rasterizer
