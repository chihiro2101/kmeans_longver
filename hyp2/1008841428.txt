in this case , mercury levels are passed in the order of crayfish , zooplankton , pre fish , fish and then the common loon resulting from this transmission of mercury , there is a significant positive correlation between mercury levels in fish and mercury levels in male , female , and chick blood of common loons ; consequently , an increase in mercury concentration in the blood of common loons and fish was seen with a decrease in ph as mercury levels and ph are correlated , scientists have found that brood success decreases with decreasing ph such that environments with a ph at around 4.5 exhibited reproductive success below a calculated positive growth rate threshold due to elevated mercury levels in lakes that common loons inhabit , many studies have revealed that a large number of common loons tested are at high risk for detrimental impacts on health and reproduction in addition , artificial floating nesting platforms have been provided for the common loon in some lakes to reduce the impact of changing water levels due to dams and other human activities the tale of the loon 's necklace was handed down in many versions among pacific coast peoples the delaware in the east of north america and the buryats of siberia also had creation stories involving the loon folk names for the common loon include '' big loon '' , '' call-up-a-storm '' , '' greenhead '' , '' hell-diver '' , '' walloon '' , '' black-billed loon '' , '' guinea duck '' , '' imber diver '' , '' ring-necked loon '' , and '' ember-goose '' state of minnesota in 1961 , and also appears on the minnesota state quarter the wailing call of the loon is widely used in film and television to evoke wilderness and suspense , and is referenced in songs such as '' old devil moon '' ( '' wan na laugh like a loon '' ) he confirms that these birds are indeed the great northern ; unfortunately , it soon transpires that he does not wish merely to observe , but wants to steal the eggs and add them to his collection ; and to do this , he must first kill the birds
