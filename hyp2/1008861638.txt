the server usually then provides identification in the form of a digital certificate the certificate contains the hostname , the trusted certificate authority ( ca ) that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate , and the server 's public encryption key the client confirms the validity of the certificate before proceeding from the application protocol point of view , tls belongs to a lower layer , although the tcp/ip model is too coarse to show it in the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer , all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the clienthello message the major problem being that the certificate needs to be reissued whenever a new virtual server is added to provide the server name , transport layer security ( tls ) extensions allow clients to include a server name indication extension ( sni ) in the extended clienthello message the current standard replaces these former versions , which are now considered obsolete : : '' the tls protocol version 1.0 '' specifies an extension to the smtp service that allows an smtp server and client to use transport-layer security to provide private , authenticated communication over the internet : '' addition of camellia cipher suites to transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' elliptic curve cryptography ( ecc ) cipher suites for transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' tls handshake message for supplemental data '' : '' using openpgp keys for transport layer security ( tls ) authentication '' , obsoleted by : '' tls elliptic curve cipher suites with sha-256/384 and aes galois counter mode ( gcm ) '' : '' transport layer security ( tls ) application-layer protocol negotiation extension '' encapsulations of tls include : : '' the eap-tls authentication protocol '' : '' summarizing known attacks on transport layer security ( tls ) and datagram tls ( dtls ) '' : '' recommendations for secure use of transport layer security ( tls ) and datagram transport layer security ( dtls ) '' application-layer protocol negotiation – a tls extension used for spdy and tls false start bullrun ( decryption program ) – a secret anti-encryption program run by the u.s creating vpns with ipsec and ssl/tls linux journal article by rami rosen
