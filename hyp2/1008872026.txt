the word salami in english comes from the plural form of the italian the name may be derived from the latin word salumen also , environmental conditions dictate what food processes are used , as seen in the mediterranean and southern europe , where '' meat products are dried to lower water activity ( aw ) values , taking advantage of the long dry and sunny days , while in northern europe , fermented sausages require smoking for further preservation '' in europe , the main countries that produce salami are france , germany , hungary , italy , and spain , which make several hundred million kilograms per year similar types of sausages are found in the middle east , where various meats such as beef , lamb , and mutton are used ; or in china , where lap cheong ( translated as '' waxed intestines '' ) are usually pork likewise , in eastern europe , hungarian salami is quite popular typical additional ingredients include : garlic minced fat salt spices , usually white pepper various herbs vinegar wine the maker usually ferments the raw meat mixture for a day , then stuffs it into either an edible natural or inedible cellulose casing , and hangs it up to cure salame cotto—typical of the piedmont region in italy—is cooked or smoked before or after curing to impart a specific flavor , but not for any benefit of cooking to achieve the flavor and texture that salami possesses , fermentation , which can also be referred to as a slow acidification process promoting a series of chemical reactions in the meat , has to take place the bacteria produce lactic acid as a waste product , which lowers the ph and coagulates the proteins , reducing the meat 's water-holding capacity now , they use starter cultures and clementi , f ripening and drying happens after fermentation about half of the water is evaporated and further water loss has to be prevented by packaging in modern manufacturing temperature and relative humidity are strictly controlled according to the size of the salami the quality of salami is dependent on the quality of the raw materials and the level of technology used in its production the shelf life of salami is mainly determined by sensory deterioration , which is the result of various oxidation phenomena ; pathogenic or spoilage bacteria do not readily proliferate in dry-cured sausage varieties also differ by coarseness or fineness of the chopped meat and size and style of the casing in northeast italy , traditional dry fermented salami sausages made of fresh pork display unique organoleptic sensory profiles characterized by accented acidity , slight sourness , and elastic semi hard consistency in germany , westphalian salami is made with fast technology from pork meat , pepper , garlic , and sometimes mustard seeds , and is smoked , firm , sliceable product with a distinct fermentation/sour flavor the sausages are stuffed into large-diameter casings and ripened by lowering the temperature from 24 & nbsp ; °c to 12–14 & nbsp ; °c until a water loss of 25 % is obtained there are many aspects of salami that can be considered both negative and positive to human health preservation of any meat products is important since several of these oils contain volatile compounds whose amount can affect the flavor of the food , researchers often perform a sensory test to find the amount of the oil that can best serve as an anti-fungal preservative but have the least effect on the flavor or appearance of the salami
