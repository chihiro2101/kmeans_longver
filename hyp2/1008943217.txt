the new york journal and new york world , owned respectively by william randolph hearst and joseph pulitzer , gave maine intense press coverage , employing tactics that would later be labeled '' yellow journalism for a week following the sinking , the journal devoted a daily average of eight and a half pages of news , editorials and pictures to the event the spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers , but the sampson board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo in 1976 , admiral hyman g . 1898 del peral and de salas inquiry hugh thomas , memoria del 98 ( 1997 edition ) , chapter 7 ( '' la explosión del maine '' ) , p 1898 sampson board 's court of inquiry ramón blanco y erenas , spanish governor of cuba , had proposed instead a joint spanish-american investigation of the sinking the fact that the officer proposed to be court president was junior to the captain of maine , wegner writes , '' would indicate either ignorance of navy regulations or that , in the beginning , the board did not intend to examine the possibility that the ship was lost by accident and the negligence of her captain '' eventually , navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board , captain sampson being senior to captain sigsbee between the proceedings and the findings , there was what wegner calls , '' a broad gap '' , where the court '' left no record of the reasoning that carried it from the often-inconsistent witnesses to its conclusion the fact that the cuban government wanted the wreck removed from havana harbor might also have played a role : it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898 , while simultaneously obliging the now-independent cubans vreeland inspected the wreck wegner says that all relevant documents were obtained and studied , including the ship 's plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of maine in 1912 ( the progress of the cofferdam ) written by william furgueson , chief engineer for the project wegner suggests that a combination of naval ship design and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the rickover study up to the time of the maines building , he explains , common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers , and american naval ships burned smokeless anthracite coal wegner explains that anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion , but bituminous coal is considerably more volatile and is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp , a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases ( chiefly methane ) firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4 % and 16 % , with most violence at around 10 % in addition , there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal : iron sulfide , also known as pyrite , was likely present the pyrites could have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion national geographic reported that '' a fire in the coal bunker could have generated sufficient heat to touch off an explosion in the adjacent magazine but on the other hand , computer analysis also shows that even a small , handmade mine could have penetrated the ship 's hull and set off explosions within '' the team noted that this was not '' definitive in proving that a mine was the cause of the sinking '' but it did '' strengthen the case '' 2002 discovery channel unsolved history investigation several claims have been made in spanish-speaking media that the sinking was a false flag operation conducted by the u.s operaciones de falsa bandera navy ship be blown up in guantanamo bay deliberately for several years , the maine was left where she sank in havana harbor , but it was evident she would have to be removed sometime by 30 june 1911 , the maines main deck was exposed holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section , through which jets of water were pumped , to break the mud seal holding the ship , then plugged , with flood cocks , which would later be used for sinking the ship keys ( an engineering officer ) , was identified and returned to his home town ;
