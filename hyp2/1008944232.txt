focusing of the magnetic field and its attendant flux metering , as illustrated in the sae paper , is required to produce a high starting force at the start of the solenoid stroke and to maintain a level or declining force as the solenoid moves through its displacement range further incrementing of the plunger causes a continuing decrease of the solenoid force thus creating an ideal condition for motion control as controlled by the current to the solenoid coil these were used in the 1950s for rotary snap-switch automation in electromechanical controls two rotary actuators on opposite ends of the rotary snap-switch shaft , can advance or reverse the switch position the rotary solenoid was invented in 1944 by george h leland , of dayton , ohio , to provide a more reliable and shock/vibration tolerant release mechanism for air-dropped bombs patent number 2,496,880 describes the electromagnet and inclined raceways that are the basis of the invention leland 's engineer , earl w this device allowed proportional , quiet positioning as well as a rapid rotation for uses such as mail sorters and conveyor gating a rotary voice coil is a rotational version of a solenoid solenoid-controlled valves are often used in irrigation systems , where a relatively weak solenoid opens and closes a small pilot valve , which in turn activates the main valve by applying fluid pressure to a piston or diaphragm that is mechanically coupled to the main valve when the key is turned to start the car ) , the small electric current forces the starter solenoid to close a pair of heavy contacts , thus relaying the large electric current to the starter motor this is a type of relay
