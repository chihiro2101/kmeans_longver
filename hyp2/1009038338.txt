this can lead to headache , nausea , vomiting , confusion , seizures , brain stem compression and respiratory arrest , and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums there is volume expansion in the body , no edema , but hyponatremia occurs siadh ( and its many causes ) hypothyroidism not enough acth beer potomania normal physiologic change of pregnancy reset osmostat there is a hypothalamic-kidney feedback system which normally maintains the concentration of the serum sodium within a narrow range this system operates as follows : in some of the cells of the hypothalamus , there are osmoreceptors which respond to an elevated serum sodium in body fluids by signalling the posterior pituitary gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone ( adh ) ( vasopressin ) also , no thirst is experienced cell swelling also produces activation of volume-regulated anion channels which is related to the release of taurine and glutamate from astrocytes an assessment is also made to determine if the person is experiencing symptoms from their hyponatremia in hypertonic hyponatremia , resorption of water by molecules such as glucose ( hyperglycemia or diabetes ) or mannitol ( hypertonic infusion ) occurs true hyponatremia , also known as hypotonic hyponatremia , is the most common type hypervolemic hyponatremia is most commonly the result of congestive heart failure , cirrhosis , or kidney disease often categorized under euvolemic is hyponatremia due to inadequate urine solute ( not enough chemicals or electrolytes to produce urine ) as occurs in beer potomania or '' tea and toast '' hyponatremia , hyponatremia due to hypothyroidism or central adrenal insufficiency , and those rare instances of hyponatremia that are truly secondary to excess water intake low volume hyponatremia , wherein adh secretion is stimulated by or associated with volume depletion ( not enough water in the body ) due to decreased effective circulating volume chronic hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop gradually over several days or weeks and symptoms and complications are typically moderate options include : mild and asymptomatic hyponatremia is treated with adequate solute intake ( including salt and protein ) and fluid restriction starting at 500 ml per day of water with adjustments based on serum sodium levels in persons with hyponatremia due to low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) from diuretics with simultaneous hypokalemia , correction of the low potassium level can assist with correction of hyponatremia in europe they are not generally recommended demeclocycline , while sometimes used for siadh , has significant side effects including potential kidney problems and sun sensitivity the disorder is more frequent in females , the elderly , and in people who are hospitalized
