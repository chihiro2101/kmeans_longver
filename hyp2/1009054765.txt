university of rochester , ny , the growth of the steam engine online history resource , chapter one the pump was successfully used to drain the inundated mines of guadalcanal , spain in 1662 edward somerset , second marquess of worcester , published a book containing several ideas he had been working on two containers were alternately filled with steam , then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense ; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container savery 's '' miner 's friend '' in 1698 thomas savery patented a steam-powered pump he called the '' miner 's friend '' , the miners friend essentially identical to somerset 's design and almost certainly a direct copy denis papin 's experimental steam cylinder and piston louis figuier in his monumental work figuer , louis '' merveilles de la science '' furne jouvet et cie , paris 1868 vol 1 , pp papin describes first pouring a small quantity of water into the bottom of a vertical cylinder , inserting a piston on a rod and after first evacuating the air below the piston , placing a fire beneath the cylinder to boil the water away and create enough steam pressure to raise the piston to the top end of the cylinder the fire was then removed , allowing the cylinder to cool , which condensed steam back into water , thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston to the end of the piston rod was attached a cord passing over two pulleys and a weight hung down from the cord 's end although the engine certainly worked as far as it went , it was devised merely to demonstrate the principle and having got this far , papin never developed it further , although in his paper he did write about the potential of boats driven by '' firetubes '' small numbers were built in other european countries , including in france , belgium , spain , and hungary , also at dannemora , sweden ( dutton and associates survey dated 24 november 2009 ) the action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking beam engine , the lever e of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building , the engine being located in-house this cycle was repeated around 12 times per minute newcomen found that his first engine would stop working after a while , and eventually discovered that this was due to small amounts of air being admitted to the cylinder with the steam current opinion is that at least on the early engines , dead-weight force pumps were used , the work of the engine being solely to lift the pump side ready for the next downwards pump stroke although the principle of the crank had long been known , pickard managed to obtain a 12-year patent in 1780 for the specific application of the crank to steam engines ; this was a setback to boulton and watt who got round the patent by applying the sun and planet motion to their advanced double-acting rotative engine of 1782 this was replaced by a newcomen engine in 1742â€“3 several new furnaces built in shropshire in the 1750s were powered in a similar way , including horsehay and ketley furnaces and madeley wood company trinder , industrial revolution in shropshire ( 3rd edn , phillimore , chichester , 2000 ) , 48 in the watt steam engine , condensation took place in an exterior condenser unit , attached to the steam cylinder via a pipe the only newcomen-style engine still extant in its original location is at what is now the elsecar heritage centre , near barnsley in south yorkshire in 1986 , a full-scale operational replica of the 1712 newcomen steam engine was completed at the black country living museum in dudley the cylinder is more than 2 metres long and 52 centimetres in diameter a static example of a newcomen engine is in the science museum
