more than 90 percent of peoples of east asian descent are lactose intolerant , in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern european descent dna and rna digestion after the b 12 -haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum , pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the b 12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor ( if ) for instance , more connections to metabolic control ( largely the glucose-insulin system ) have been uncovered in recent years the secretion is inhibited by low ph secretin â€“ is in the duodenum and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the pancreas and it stimulates the bile secretion in the liver in the mouth , pharynx and esophagus , ph is typically about 6.8 , very weakly acidic this acidity confers two benefits : it denatures proteins for further digestion in the small intestines , and provides innate immune system , damaging or eliminating various pathogens
