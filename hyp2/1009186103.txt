the background was heavily influenced by medieval france and christianity , with knights ( tournaments , courtly love , fiefs , political influence ) , a hierarchical priesthood who could perform miracles , and a large section on monsters that included the infernal court of demons in addition to ideas taken from arthurian myth , the first edition also incorporated elements of j tolkien including hobbits and balrogs these references have disappeared in subsequent editions for reasons of copyright the conceptualization of the races of elves , dwarves , halflings , orcs , and golblins were taken from j.r.r lovecraft 's cthulhu mythos cycle , fritz leiber 's lankmar series , and michael moorcock 's elric to allow campaigns set in their fictional worlds howard , jack vance , fritz leiber , l sprague de camp and michael moorcock dwarf , hobbit , or monster the c & s version of charisma ( leadership ) is a derived secondary characteristic used for leading and inspiring retainers the character 's alignment is different than that of dungeons & dragons , 2000 ) , pp.28-29 which allows the player to give a little more depth to the character clerics are also present , but are almost exclusively of a monotheistic faith with a christian-like hierarchy ( as the game was intended as a simulation of an essentially medieval christian europe ) backhaus , wilf and simbalist , edward chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc combat in c & s attempts to be more realistic than the abstract systems of games such as d & d , though it still has the armour class and hit table concepts it was created by wilf backhaus and inspired mainly by real magic by isaac bonewits on the other hand , the personal magick factor ( pmf ) of a magician depends on its characteristics and its mkl and defines its ability to affect the world around them this aspect of magic is questionable because the power of a spell will depend in some cases the level of the spell ( spells the highest levels being most powerful ) but for basic magic spells will no longer depend on the level of the spell but the magician pmf is to say its power for example , an intermediate magician ( e.g there are 21 classes of magick users are available , divided into four main categories : magicians nature , arcana minor arcana major and mystics the medium magick user draws knowledge and powers from spirit-guides and ghosts the shaman magick user draws power from pagan nature spirits to perform invocations and miracle effects like a christian cleric the necromancer animates and commands the undead this is automatic if the spell has a bmr 0 ; otherwise it requires a throw of the dice finally , if the spell is an illusion or charm , the target is allowed an attribute-based saving throw to resist its effects , using either intelligence ( for illusions ) or wisdom ( for command or charm ) from mkl1 , any self-respecting magician will undertake the manufacture of a focus , a long-term undertaking that can last several years of game time the balrog is from j.r.r tolkien 's lord of the rings they include ( in ascending order of power ) : gargoyles , imps , balrogs , elementary of four elements , jinn of the ring , jinn of the lamp and efreet , knights of hell , fallen angel , powers , principalities and lords of hell at the top of the demonic hierarchy despite the interest and realism of the system , which makes a case demonic invocations no mage can not afford to treat lightly , this part of the system has not been well integrated with the rules of magic and is confined to the end of the rules guilds and secret societies of magicians but there are also guilds of artificers and blacksmiths who sell magic items to those fortunate enough to encounter them the members of such an order , very limited and highly selective , are the natural enemies of sorcerers , necromancers and by extension any user of black magick which aims to get more power through knowledge and use of magic '' in the september 1980 edition ( issue 4 ) , eric goldberg liked the well-researched information on the medieval period — particularly heraldry — presented in the rules , but bemoaned the complexity , saying , '' the worst problem arises when the game is actually played — it can move as awkwardly as an octopus on dry land if you are not , stay away , it is not for you this avoids the anachronisms and gives a useful indication of technological advances at each period , allowing campaigns to be made more realistic ;
