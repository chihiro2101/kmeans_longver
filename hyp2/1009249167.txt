rockefeller center would inevitably be disorganized in its earliest years , it would eventually adhere to a certain '' order '' , and he also praised the complex for being a paragon of '' noble '' and '' efficient '' construction even though allen thought that the art was mediocre and the opportunities for a less lively complex were wasted , he stated that rockefeller center had an aura of '' festivity '' around it , unlike most other office buildings in america henry luce , the founder of time inc haskell wrote in 1966 that rockefeller center 's designers '' seemed to have regarded urban life as an enhanceable romance '' '' the new york state office of parks , recreation and historic preservation commissioned a report in 1974 entitled '' grand central terminal and rockefeller center : a historic-critical estimate of their significance '' , in which they concluded that rockefeller center , along with central park and grand central terminal , were the only three developments that
