the berlin foundry cup depicts scaffolding in ancient greece ( early 5th century bc ) the process was revolutionized by daniel palmer jones and david henry jones palmer-jones followed this up with the improved '' universal coupler '' in 1919 - this soon became the industry standard coupling and has remained so to this day the basic components of scaffolding are tubes , couplers and boards tubes are usually made either of steel or aluminium ; although there is composite scaffolding which uses filament-wound tubes of glass fibre in a nylon or polyester matrix , because of the high cost of composite tube , it is usually only used when there is a risk from overhead electric cables that can not be isolated in addition to the boards for the working platform , there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect , although ordinary boards can also be used only right angle couplers and swivel couplers can be used to fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection ' the standards , also called uprights , are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load '' american '' has the transoms attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations to limit sway a facade brace is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level box ties are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features the reveal tube is usually held in place by a reveal screw pin ( an adjustable threaded bar ) and protective packing at either end reveal ties are not well regarded , they rely solely on friction and need regular checking so it is not recommended that more than half of all ties be reveal ties bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries bamboo scaffolding was first introduced into the building industry in hong kong immediately after colonization in the 1800s the use of bamboo scaffolding is diminishing due to shortages in labor and material they are scared of it young generations do not like jobs that involve hard work in many african countries , notably nigeria , bamboo scaffolding is still used for small scale construction in urban areas nylon mesh the perimeter of bamboo scaffold should be covered by nylon mesh against falling objects the horizontal distance between steel brackets is about 3 metres the edges of working platforms should be protected by no less than 2 horizontal bamboo members of the scaffold , at intervals between 750 & nbsp ; mm to 900 & nbsp ; mm and suitable toe-boards no less than 200 & nbsp ; mm high special scaffold all scaffolds with a height excess of 15 metres shall be designed by an engineer competent examiner they should complete a formal training in bamboo scaffolding work or hold a trade test certificate on bamboo scaffolding and have at least 10 years of relevant experience bamboo scaffolding is a temporary structure to support people and materials when constructing or repairing building exteriors and interiors chinese opera is one of the world 's '' intangible cultural heritages '' cheung chau bun festival the bamboo tower used in the famous bun scrambling competition during the cheung chau bun festival on the island of cheung chau is constructed out of bamboo scaffolding for the piu sik parade , bamboo stands and racks are used to hold the young costumed performers above the crowds types of scaffolding covered by the occupational health and safety administration in the united states include the following categories : pole ; tube and coupler ; fabricated frame ( tubular welded frame scaffolds ) ; plasterers ’ , decorators ’ , and large area scaffolds ; bricklayers ' ( pipe ) ; horse ; form scaffolds and carpenters ’ bracket scaffolds ; roof brackets ; outrigger ; pump jacks ; ladder jacks ; window jacks ; crawlingboards ( chicken ladders ) ; step , platform , and trestle ladder scaffolds ; single-point adjustable suspension ; two-point adjustable suspension ( swing stages ) ; multipoint adjustable suspension ; stonesetters ’ multipoint adjustable suspension scaffolds , and masons ’ multipoint adjustable suspension scaffolds ; catenary ; float ( ship ) ; interior hung ; needle beam ; multilevel suspended ; mobile ; repair bracket scaffolds ; and stilts file : coupler 1.jpg tube and clamp scaffold detail file : carpenter at work on the first unit of the new alpine village at the outskirts of helen when completed the project file : fotothek df tg 0003033 mechanik ^ hebezeug ^ winde ^ seil.jpg a type of putlog scaffold where the putlogs go through the wall and are relatively balanced on each side in addition to the putlog couplers ( discussed above ) , there are also putlog tubes these have a flattened end or have been fitted with a blade the putlogs are transoms - attached to the ledger at one end but integrated into the bricks at the other spacing is the same on a putlog scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold , and ties are still required the purpose for this alternative method is to create a good anchoring point for additional vertical scaffolding to clamp on to , most commonly used in live events and festivals with scaffolding poles upto 21foot in height where festoon lighting , cabling and bunting can be hung from safely the widespread use of scaffolding systems , along with the profound importance that they earned in modern applications such as civil engineering projects and temporary structures , led to the definition of a series of standards covering a vast number of specific issues involving scaffolding din 4421 , a din standard which covers the analysis , design and construction of falsework 29 cfr part 1926 : safety standards for scaffolds used in the construction industry from the u.s occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) , with an accompanying '' construction etool ''
