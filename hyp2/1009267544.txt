at the advent of laser cooling techniques , maxwell 's theory of electromagnetism had already led to the quantification of electromagnetic radiation exerting a force ( radiation pressure ) , however it was n't until the turn of the twentieth century when studies by lebedev ( 1901 ) , nichols ( 1901 ) , and hull ( 1903 ) experimentally demonstrated that force closely following ashkin 's letter in 1978 , two research groups : wineland , drullinger and walls , and neuhauser , hohenstatt , toscheck and dehmelt further refined that work now , temperatures around 240 microkelvins were reached because the light is detuned to the '' red '' ( i.e , & nbsp ; at lower frequency ) of the transition , the atoms will absorb more photons if they move towards the light source , due to the doppler effect if the atom , which is now in the excited state , then emits a photon spontaneously , it will be kicked by the same amount of momentum , but in a random direction if the absorption and emission are repeated many times , the average speed , and therefore the kinetic energy of the atom , will be reduced laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms , but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems laser-cooling brings large object near absolute zero in 2011 , a team from the california institute of technology and the university of vienna became the first to laser-cool a ( 10 μm x 1 μm ) mechanical object to its quantum ground state
