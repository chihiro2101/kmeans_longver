if a parabola is positioned in cartesian coordinates with its vertex at the origin and its axis of symmetry along the y-axis , so the parabola opens upward , its equation is \scriptstyle 4fy x^2 , where \scriptstyle f is its focal length ) correspondingly , the dimensions of a symmetrical paraboloidal dish are related by the equation : \scriptstyle 4fd r^2 , where \scriptstyle f is the focal length , \scriptstyle d is the depth of the dish ( measured along the axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim ) , and \scriptstyle r is the radius of the dish from the center this is sometimes called the '' linear diameter '' , and equals the diameter of a flat , circular sheet of material , usually metal , which is the right size to be cut and bent to make the dish two intermediate results are useful in the calculation : \scriptstyle p 2f ( or the equivalent : \scriptstyle p \frac , where f , d , and r are defined as above ( for a geometrical proof , click here for example , the flaw in the hubble space telescope mirror ( too flat by about 2,200 & nbsp ; nm at its perimeter ) caused severe spherical aberration until corrected with costar microwaves , such as are used for satellite-tv signals , have wavelengths of the order of ten millimetres , so dishes to focus these waves can be wrong by half a millimetre or so and still perform well this allows it to be easily turned so it can be aimed at a moving source of light , such as the sun in the sky , while its focus , where the target is located , is stationary the angular radius of the rim as seen from the focal point is 72.68 degrees the focus-balanced configuration ( see above ) requires the depth of the reflector dish to be greater than its focal length , so the focus is within the dish however , if the reflector is used to focus incoming energy onto a receiver , the shadow of the receiver falls onto the vertex of the paraboloid , which is part of the reflector , so part of the reflector is wasted accurate off-axis reflectors , for use in solar furnaces and other non-critical applications , can be made quite simply by using a rotating furnace , in which the container of molten glass is offset from the axis of rotation the principle of parabolic reflectors has been known since classical antiquity , when the mathematician diocles described them in his book on burning mirrors and proved that they focus a parallel beam to a point the design he came up with bears his name : the '' gregorian telescope '' ; but according to his own confession , gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of actually constructing one the most common modern applications of the parabolic reflector are in satellite dishes , reflecting telescopes , radio telescopes , parabolic microphones , solar cookers , and many lighting devices such as spotlights , headlight , par lamps and led housings when an object is placed on the bottom mirror , the mirrors create a real image , which is a virtually identical copy of the original that appears in the opening
