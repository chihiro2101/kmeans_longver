barnacles are encrusters , attaching themselves temporarily to a hard substrate free-living barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae ; in effect , the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead these consist of the rostrum , two lateral plates , two carinolaterals , and a carina the blood vascular system is minimal the excretory organs of barnacles are maxillary glands this undergoes six moults , passing through five instars , before transforming into the cyprid stage to facilitate genetic transfer between isolated individuals , barnacles have extraordinarily long penises‚Å† the rhizocephala superorder used to be considered hermaphroditic , but it turned out that its males inject themselves into the female 's body , degrading to the condition of nothing more than sperm-producing cells these feathery appendages beat rhythmically to draw plankton and detritus into the shell for consumption other members of the class have quite a different mode of life they also have numerous predators fast growth allows the suspension feeders to access higher levels of the water column than their competitors , and to be large enough to resist displacement ; species employing this response , such as the aptly named megabalanus , can reach in length ; other species may grow larger still ( austromegabalanus psittacus ) competitors may include other barnacles , and disputed evidence indicates balanoid barnacles competitively displaced chthalamoid barnacles among the most common predators on barnacles are whelks another predator on barnacles is the starfish species pisaster ochraceus darwin undertook this study , at the suggestion of his friend joseph dalton hooker , to thoroughly understand at least one species before making the generalisations needed for his theory of evolution by natural selection the degree of disarticluation of fossils suggests the distance they have been transported , and since many species have narrow ranges of water depths , it can be assumed that the animals lived in shallow water and broke up as they were washed down-slope the stable isotope signals in the layers of barnacle shells can potentially be used as a forensic tracking method for whales , loggerhead turtles and marine debris , such as shipwrecks or a flaperon suspected to be from malaysia airlines flight 370 the resemblance of this barnacle 's fleshy stalk to a goose 's neck gave rise , in ancient times , to the notion that geese literally grew from the barnacle file : percebes.iguaria.jpg goose barnacle being enjoyed in a spanish restaurant in madrid
