most amphibians will work only as a displacement hull when in the water – only a small number of designs have the capability to raise out of the water when speed is gained , to achieve high velocity hydroplaning , skimming over the water surface like motorboat the first known self-propelled amphibious vehicle , a steam-powered wheeled dredging barge , named the orukter amphibolos , was conceived and built by united states inventor oliver evans in 1805 , although it is disputed to have successfully travelled over land or water under its own steam richmond ( jessup , iowa , usa ) in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle his design , unlike others , could operate not only on rivers and lakes but the sea and did not require firm ground to enter or exit the water in 1931 , he tested a scaled down version of his invention iguana yachts , a france company created in 2008 , has developed amphibious motorboats featuring all-terrain tracks several amphibious cycles have been created by engineering students as university projects gibbs sports amphibians inc typically an amphibious atv ( aatv ) is a small , lightweight , off-highway vehicle , constructed from an integral hard plastic or fibreglass bodytub , fitted with six ( sometimes eight ) driven wheels , with low pressure , balloon tires although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water – albeit slowly – outboard motors can be added for extended water use the quadski was developed using gibbs ' high-speed amphibian technology , which gibbs originally developed for the aquada , an amphibious car , which the company has still not produced because of regulatory issues 1900 , however the second world war significantly stimulated their development two of the most significant amphibious cars to date were developed during world war ii the most proliferous was the german schwimmwagen , a small jeep-like 4x4 vehicle designed by the porsche engineering firm in 1942 and widely used in world war ii amfibus amphibious buses made by dutch amfibious transport ( dat ) in nijmegen , netherlands are used to operate tours of amsterdam , rotterdam and lübeck , under the splashtours brand the buses have a volvo chassis and carry 43 passengers a tour of lübeck was launched in 2014 oyster farmers in jersey make use of similar boats in the 1950s , the soviets developed the gaz-46 , bav 485 , and pts the latter was based on a 1950s civil construction vehicle and became the us army 's standard heavy tactical truck before its replacement by the hemtt coupled with its amphibious capability , in the vietnam war , the m520 goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks could not many modern military vehicles , ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance vehicles , through armoured personnel carriers ( apcs ) , tanks and amphibious warfare ships , are manufactured with amphibious capabilities it entered service in 1976 and around 5000 were produced in many configurations most of the vehicles the soviets designed were amphibious or could ford deep water to provide motive power , they use their tracks , sometimes with an added propeller or water jets soviet examples are the pt-76 amphibious tank , and the btr-50 and mt-lb apcs based on its chassis the british tanks 1915-1919 in world war ii the british further developed amphibious tanks the valentine , then the m4 sherman medium tank were made amphibious with the addition of a rubberized canvas screen to provide additional buoyancy and propellers driven by the main engine to give propulsion in 1969 , the u.s the m551 upon arrival in vietnam began replacing the m48 tank in all cavalry squadrons , leaving only the m48a3 in the u.s the sheridan needed no modifications for river crossings , crewmen simply raised the cloth sides that were tucked inside rubber tubes along the hull 's upper edges , raised the driver 's front shield which had an acrylic glass window , the driver turned on his bilge pumps , shifted his transmission lever to water operations and the sheridan entered the water during the cold war , the swedish stridsvagn 103 main battle tank carried flotation gear all the time and was , therefore , theoretically , always amphibious usually , the front unit houses at least the engine , gearboxes , fuel tank ( s ) and the driver 's compartment , and perhaps there is some space left for cargo or passengers , whereas the rear unit is the primary load carrier the germans gave their tiger i a long snorkel , essentially a long tube on the commander 's hatch that allowed it to wade through four metres of water acvs have a high speed over water ( an sr.n4 mk.1 could do 83 knots ( 95 & nbsp ; mph or 154 & nbsp ; km/h ) ) and can make the transition between land and water at speed—unlike most wheeled or tracked amphibians for some military applications wheeled and tracked amphibious vehicles are slowly being supplanted by air-cushioned landing craft clarkson used a toyota hilux , which he nicknamed the '' toybota '' , and powered it with a large outboard motor both hammond and may 's vessels sank shortly after departing , and all three presenters ended up making the trip aboard clarkson 's vehicle top gear usa featured a very similar challenge in s04e06 the jeep sank as well after foust and ferrara got into an impromptu sea battle
