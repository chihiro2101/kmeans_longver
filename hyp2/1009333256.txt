x-ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) studies of canavalia ensiformis ( jack bean ) , klebsiella aerogenes and sporosarcina pasteurii ( formerly known as bacillus pasteurii ) confirm 5–6 coordinate nickel ions with exclusively o/n ligation , including two imidazole ligands per nickel it begins with a nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl oxygen of the urea molecule onto the 5-coordinate ni ( ni-1 ) a lone pair of electrons from one of the nitrogen atoms on the urea molecule creates a double bond with the central carbon , and the resulting nh 2 − of the coordinated substrate interacts with a nearby positively charged group from the crystal structures from k aerogenes urease , it was argued that the general base used in the blakely mechanism , his 320 , was too far away from the ni2-bound water to deprotonate in order to form the attacking hydroxide moiety as this histidine ligand is part of the mobile flap , binding of the urea substrate for catalysis closes this flap over the active site and with the addition of the hydrogen bonding pattern to urea from other ligands in the pocket , speaks to the selectivity of the urease enzyme for urea urea binds to the five-coordinated nickel ( ni1 ) with the carbonyl oxygen atom however the carbonyl oxygens of ala α170 and ala α366 enhance the basicity of the nh 2 groups and allow for binding to ni2 therefore , in this proposed mechanism , the positioning of urea in the active site is induced by the structural features of the active site residues which are positioned to act as hydrogen-bond donors in the vicinity of ni1 and as acceptors in the vicinity of ni2 infection stones infection induced urinary stones are a mixture of struvite ( mgnh 4 po 4 •6h 2 o ) and carbonate apatite ca 10 ( po 4 ) 6•co 3 urease in hepatic encephalopathy / hepatic coma studies have shown that helicobacter pylori along with cirrhosis of the liver cause hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic coma helicobacter pylori are microbial ureases found in the stomach in the stomach there is an increase in ph of the mucosal lining as a result of urea hydrolysis , which prevents movement of hydrogen ions between gastric glands and gastric lumen . occurrence and applications in agriculture heavy use of urea is thought to promote eutrophication , despite the observation that urea is rapidly transformed by microbial ureases , and thus usually does not persist , morganella , providencia , and possibly serratia spp brucella staphylococcus saprophyticus staphylococcus aureus
