single and multiple scattering the main difference between the effects of single and multiple scattering is that single scattering can usually be treated as a random phenomenon , whereas multiple scattering , somewhat counterintuitively , can be modeled as a more deterministic process because the combined results of a large number of scattering events tend to average out this is exemplified by a light beam passing through thick fog speckle also occurs if multiple parts of a coherent wave scatter from different centers these systems are considered to be some of the most difficult to model accurately more precisely , scattering consists of the study of how solutions of partial differential equations , propagating freely '' in the distant past '' , come together and interact with one another or with a boundary condition , and then propagate away '' to the distant future '' image : electron-scattering.png thumb 220px a feynman diagram of scattering between two electrons by emission of a virtual photon major forms of elastic light scattering ( involving negligible energy transfer ) are rayleigh scattering and mie theory inelastic scattering includes brillouin scattering , raman scattering , inelastic x-ray scattering and compton scattering surfaces described as white owe their appearance to multiple scattering of light by internal or surface inhomogeneities in the object , for example by the boundaries of transparent microscopic crystals that make up a stone or by the microscopic fibers in a sheet of paper the inherent scattering that radiation undergoes passing through a pure gas is due to microscopic density fluctuations as the gas molecules move around , which are normally small enough in scale for rayleigh 's model to apply seinfeld , john h ; pandis , spyros n atmospheric chemistry and physics - from air pollution to climate change ( 2nd ed
