william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time this closure cuts off the escaping air this creates an oval gap between the folds and some air escapes , lowering the pressure inside the trachea in skilled countertenors , however , the mucous membrane of the vocal folds contact with each other completely during each vibration cycle the mass corresponding to the innermost part of the thyro-arytenoid muscle remains still and motionless some singers feel a sense of muscular relief when they change from the modal register to the falsetto register while scientific evidence has proven that women have a falsetto register , the issue of 'female falsetto ' has been met with controversy among teachers of singing celebrated opera singer and voice teacher richard miller pointed out in his 1997 publication national schools of singing : english , french , german , and italian that while the german school of voice teachers had largely embraced the idea of a female falsetto into pedagogical practice , there is division within the french and english schools and a complete rejection of the idea of female falsetto in the italian school of singing he believes that this failure to recognize the female falsetto voice has led to the misidentification of young contraltos and mezzo-sopranos as sopranos , as it is easier for these lower voice types to sing in the soprano tessitura using their falsetto register the new grove dictionary of music & musicians edited by stanley sadie , volume 6 the physician , giovanni camillo maffei , in his book discorso della voce e del modo d'apparare di cantar di garganta in 1562 , explained that when a bass singer sang in the soprano range , the voice was called '' falsetto '' clippinger most likely equivalent to the middle voice of a woman , copyright macmillan publishers limited 1980 brian wilson of the beach boys sang falsetto on multiple beach boys tunes providing a dose of saccharine for the band 's signature harmonies many hawaiian songs feature falsetto the type of vocal cord vibration that produces the falsetto voice precludes loud singing except in the highest tones of that register ; it also limits the available tone colors because of the simplicity of its waveform the following list includes the most common ones : popular music in r & b/soul music in doo wop in gospel music in rock music in reggae in a cappella music in blues in yodeling in country music in bluegrass in folk music in irish music in barbershop music for the tenor voice ( not always necessary ) and occasionally with the lead and baritone voices in certain arrangements the use of falsetto is considered uncommon in normal western speech and is most often employed within the context of humor its use has also been noted in the u.s
