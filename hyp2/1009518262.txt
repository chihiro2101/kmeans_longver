in april 1981 , the space shuttle columbia launched , the start of regular manned access to orbital space in the united states , the department of defense and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products most of those jobs were in washington state and in california , with missouri , new york and texas also being important workers age and retire important locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include washington state ( boeing ) , california ( boeing , lockheed martin , etc ) ; montreal , canada ( bombardier , pratt & whitney canada ) ; toulouse , france ( airbus/eads ) ; hamburg , germany ( airbus/eads ) ; and são josé dos campos , brazil ( embraer ) , querétaro , mexico ( bombardier aerospace , general electric aviation ) and mexicali , mexico ( united technologies corporation , gulfstream aerospace ) ( formerly finmeccnica ) account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort , with the european space agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products the united kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry , making its own airliners and warplanes , but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies , and it has turned into a large import customer , too , from countries such as the united states another notable example was the late 1950s development of the avro canada cf-105 arrow , a supersonic fighter-interceptor whose 1959 cancellation was considered highly controversial the national engineering and scientific commission , khan research laboratories and pakistan aeronautical complex are among the premier organizations involved in research and development in this sector pakistan has the capability of designing and manufacturing guided rockets , missiles and space vehicles in the people 's republic of china , beijing , xi'an , chengdu , shanghai , shenyang and nanchang are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry the aircraft parts industry was born out of the sale of second-hand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector in the aerospace and defense industry , much consolidation has occurred at the end of the 20th century , going into the 21st century the largest transactions have been : the acquisition of rockwell collins by united technologies corporation for 30.0 bil usd in 1999 ( now called : bae systems ) the acquisition of hughes aircraft by raytheon for 9.5 bil multiple technologies and innovations are used in aerospace , many of them pioneered around world war ii : patented by short brothers , to improve low-speed performance , a de havilland dh4 was modified by handley page to a monoplane with high-lift devices : full-span leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps ; in 1924 , fowler flaps that extend backward and downward were invented in the us , and used on the lockheed model 10 electra while in 1943 forward-hinged leading-edge krueger flaps were invented in germany and later used on the boeing 707 in 1935 , britain demonstrated aircraft radio detection and ranging and in 1940 the raf introduced the first vhf airborne radars on bristol blenheims , then higher-resolution microwave-frequency radar with a cavity magnetron on bristol beaufighters in 1941 , and in 1959 the radar-homing hughes aim-4 falcon became the first us guided missile on the convair f-106 ziegler , was brought to the us under operation paperclip along wernher von braun and vanguard 1 was its first application in 1958 , later enhanced in space-deployable structures like the international space station solar arrays of functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment these spinoffs have applications in a variety of different fields including medicine , transportation , energy , consumer goods , public safety and more
