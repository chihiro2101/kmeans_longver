mechanoreceptors are identified respectively by type i slowly-adapting with multiple merkel corpuscle end-organs and type ii slowly-adapting with single ruffini corpuscle end-organs , as well as type i rapidly-adapting with multiple meissner corpuscle end-organs and type ii rapidly-adapting with single pacinian corpuscle end-organs the dominant nerve supply to the nipple comes from the lateral cutaneous branches of fourth intercostal nerve the venous vessels parallel the arteries 75 % of the lymph is drained through the axillary lymph nodes located near the armpit since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women , the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth the nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple if a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped , white and flattened , this may indicates that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples the consistency can be thick , thin , sticky or watery nipple discharge is most often not cancer ( benign ) , but rarely , it can be a sign of breast cancer nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipples are squeezed most of the time a mammogram and an examination of the fluid is done a fine needle aspiration ( fna ) biopsy can be fast and least painful scaly , flaking , itchy nipple - this is most often due to eczema or a bacterial or fungal infection this is not an expected change warning signs can be : new lump in the nipple , or breast or armpit thickening or swelling of part of the breast , areola , or nipple irritation or dimpling of breast skin redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area nipple discharge other than breast milk , including blood any change in the size or the shape of the breast or nipple pain in any area of the breast changes in the nipple are not necessarily symptoms or signs of breast cancer the infant will transmit the infection to the mother most of the time , this infection is localized to the area of the nipple herpes in the newborn is a serious and sometimes fatal infection the exposure of nipples is usually considered modesty and in some instances is viewed as lewd or indecent behavior appears in a state of nudity commits public indecency it 's a permissible law some states do not allow the visualization of any part of the breast such is the case in west virginia and massachusetts west virginia 's regulation is very specific and is not likely to be misinterpreted , stating : '' the display of 'any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress , blouse , skirt , leotard , bathing suit , or other wearing apparel is permitted provided the areola is not exposed , in whole or in part nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is ok , too '' another recent development is the instagram page that invites users to post images of nipples from both sexes ; genderless_nipples , which displays close ups of both the nipples of men and women for the purpose of spotlighting what may be inconsistency nipples can be sensitive to touch , and nipple stimulation can incite sexual arousal the second of the two , tit , was inherited directly from proto-germanic , while the first entered english via old french
