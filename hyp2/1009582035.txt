nature stem cell blog the scientist 19 june 2007 though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals , questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum these earlier experiments used procedures developed in non-primate animals with little success in april 2014 , an international research team expanded on this break through epigenetic and age related changes were thought to possibly hinder an adult somatic cells ability to be reprogrammed implementing the procedure pioneered by the oregon research group they indeed were able to grow stem cells generated by scnt using adult cells from two donors aged 35 and 75 , indicating that age does not impede a cell 's ability to be reprogrammed this technique is currently the basis for cloning animals ( such as the famous dolly the sheep ) , and has been proposed as a possible way to clone humans high fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species interspecies nuclear transfer ( iscnt ) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer being used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species , or even to restore species after their extinction in 2000 , robert lanza was able to produce a cloned fetus of a gaur , bos gaurus , combining it successfully with a domestic cow , bos taurus moreover , ncsu23 medium , which was designed for in vitro culture of pig embryos , was able to support the in vitro development of cattle , mice , and chicken iscnt embryos up to the blastocyst stage furthermore , ovine oocyte cytoplast may be used for remodeling and reprogramming of human somatic cells back to the embryonic stage only three of these embryos survived until birth , and only one survived to adulthood the biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from understood another limitation is trying to use one-cell embryos during the scnt andrews , et al retrieved on august 7 , 2006 or its prohibition this is a minimally invasive procedure , but it does carry some health risks , such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome for example , to treat a man with parkinson 's disease , a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by scnt into an egg cell from an egg donor , creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient 's own cells ( there would be differences ) potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy , and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyper-ovulation ( ovulating several eggs at once ) andy coghlan , '' cloning opponents fear loopholes in new uk law '' , new scientist ( november 23 , 2001 , retrieved october 6 , 2006 ) permission
