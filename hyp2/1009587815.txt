shaped like a section of a large aerofoil ( this creates a low pressure area above the wing much like an aircraft ) , the craft was propelled by four aero engines driving two submerged marine propellers , with a fifth engine that blew air under the front of the craft to increase the air pressure under it the theoretical grounds for motion over an air layer were constructed by konstantin eduardovich tsiolkovskii in 1926 and 1927 91-95 in 1931 , finnish aero engineer toivo j government , fletcher could not file a patent in theory , only a small amount of active airflow would be needed to create lift and much less than a design that relied only on the momentum of the air to provide lift , like a helicopter cockerell built and tested several models of his hovercraft design in somerleyton , suffolk , during the early 1950s for low-speed maneuverability , the extra thrust could be directed fore or aft , differentially for rotation raymond wheeler , '' from river to sea '' , cross publishing , 1993 skirts and other improvements although the sr.n1 was successful as a testbed , the design hovered too close to the surface to be practical ; at even small waves would hit the bow the solution was offered by c.h latimer-needham and cockerell devised a high skirt design , which was fitted to the sr.n1 to produce the mk v , bill gunston , '' hydrofoils and hovercraft : new vehicles for sea and land '' , doubleday , 1969 , p.93 displaying hugely improved performance , with the ability to climb over obstacles almost as high as the skirt found the solution to this problem instead of using two separate rubber sheets to form the skirt , a single sheet of rubber was bent into a u shape to provide both sides , with slots cut into the bottom of the u forming the annular vent by 1962 , many uk aviation and ship building firms were working on hovercraft designs , including saunders roe/westland , vickers-armstrong , william denny , britten-norman and folland the n500 could carry 400 passengers , 55 cars and five buses it was rejected by its operators , who claimed that it was unreliable the british aircraft and marine engineering company saunders-roe built the first practical human-carrying hovercraft for the national research development corporation , the sr.n1 , which carried out several test programmes in 1959 to 1961 ( the first public demonstration was in 1959 ) , including a cross-channel test run in july 1959 , piloted by peter '' sheepy '' lamb , an ex-naval test pilot and the chief test pilot at saunders roe it was powered by two turboprop aero-engines and driven by propellers the world 's first car-carrying hovercraft was made in 1968 , the bhc sr.n4 ( sr.n4 ) models , each powered by four bristol proteus turboshaft engines the service ceased on 1 october 2000 after 32 & nbsp ; years , due to competition with traditional ferries , catamaran , the disappearance of duty-free shopping within the eu , the advancing age of the sr.n4 hovercraft and the opening of the channel tunnel although developed elsewhere in the world for both civil and military purposes , except for the solent ryde to southsea crossing , hovercraft disappeared from the coastline of britain until a range of griffon hovercraft were bought by the royal national lifeboat institution numerous fire departments around the us/canadian great lakes operate hovercraft for water and ice rescues , often of ice fisherman stranded when ice breaks off from shore in 1998 , the us postal service began using the british built hoverwork ap1-88 to haul mail , freight , and passengers from bethel , alaska , to and from eight small villages along the kuskokwim river bethel is far removed from the alaska road system , thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service since the channel routes abandoned hovercraft , and pending any reintroduction on the scottish route , the united kingdom 's only public hovercraft service is that operated by hovertravel between southsea ( portsmouth ) and ryde on the isle of wight in japan the last commercial line had linked ōita airport and central ōita but was shut down in october 2009 the first application of the hovercraft for military use was by the british armed forces , using hovercraft built by saunders-roe in the us , during the 1960s , bell licensed and sold the saunders-roe sr.n5 as the bell sk-5 they were deployed on trial to the vietnam war by the united states navy as pacv patrol craft in the mekong delta where their mobility and speed was unique they saw action primarily in the đồng tháp mười the only remaining u.s with the fall of the soviet union , most soviet military hovercraft fell into disuse and disrepair the prototype of the class , tuuli , was commissioned in 2000 it proved an extremely successful design for a littoral fast attack craft , but due to fiscal reasons and doctrinal change in the navy , the hovercraft was soon withdrawn small commercially manufactured , kit or plan-built hovercraft are increasingly being used for recreational purposes , such as inland racing and cruising on inland lakes and rivers , marshy areas , estuaries and inshore coastal waters similar events are also held in europe and the us apart from the craft designed as '' racing hovercraft '' , which are often only suitable for racing , there is another form of small personal hovercraft for leisure use , often referred to as cruising hovercraft , capable of carrying up to four people mackace ( mackley air cushion equipment ) , now known as hovertrans , produced a number of successful hoverbarges , such as the 250 & nbsp ; ton payload '' sea pearl '' , which operated in abu dhabi , and the twin 160 & nbsp ; ton payload '' yukon princesses '' , which ferried trucks across the yukon river to aid the pipeline build hoverbarges are still in operation today '' history of the hoverbarge '' the initial concept of the air cushion barge has always been to provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing construction sites using typical equipment found in this area , such as diesel engines , ventilating fans , winches and marine equipment the vehicle achieved on 7 february 1973 but the project was cancelled a week later only long , the line reaches a maximum speed of they were also known as aerotrains since one of the builders had a licence from bertin 's aerotrain company three separate projects were funded , garrett airesearch and grumman they were not especially good as vacuum cleaners as the air escaping from under the cushion blew uncollected dust in all directions , nor as hovercraft as their lack of a skirt meant that they only hovered effectively over a smooth surface the service , operated by hovertravel , schedules up to three crossings each hour , and provides the fastest way of getting on or off the island world 's largest civil hovercraft – the bhc sr.n4 mk.iii , at 56.4 & nbsp ;
