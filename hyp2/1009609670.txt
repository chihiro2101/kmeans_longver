randomized experiments appeared in psychology , where they were introduced by charles sanders peirce and joseph jastrow in the 1880s , and in education later , in the early 20th century , randomized experiments appeared in agriculture , due to jerzy neyman neyman , jerzy '' statistical science 5 ( 4 ) : 465–472 dabrowska and terence p fisher 's experimental research and his writings popularized randomized experiments according to , ronald a in that book he emphasized examples and how & nbsp ; to & nbsp ; design experiments systematically from a statistical point of view as of 2004 , more than 150,000 rcts were in the cochrane library although the principle of clinical equipoise ( '' genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community finally , zelen 's design , which has been used for some rcts , randomizes subjects before they provide informed consent , which may be ethical for rcts of screening and selected therapies , but is likely unethical '' for most therapeutic trials from most to least common in the healthcare literature , the major categories of rct study designs are : parallel study – each participant is randomly assigned to a group , and all the participants in the group receive ( or do not receive ) an intervention , villages , schools ) are randomly selected to receive ( or not receive ) an intervention , group 1 receives vitamin x and vitamin y , group 2 receives vitamin x and placebo y , group 3 receives placebo x and vitamin y , and group 4 receives placebo x and placebo y ) . by outcome of interest ( efficacy vs rcts can be classified as '' explanatory '' or '' pragmatic by hypothesis ( superiority vs another classification of rcts categorizes them as '' superiority trials '' , '' noninferiority trials '' , and '' equivalence trials '' , which differ in methodology and reporting minimize allocation bias ( or confounding ) , an '' accidental bias '' ) the major types of restricted randomization used in rcts are : randomized block design or blocked randomization : a '' block size '' and '' allocation ratio '' ( number of subjects in one group versus the other group ) are specified , and subjects are allocated randomly within each block the methods are thought to be less affected by selection bias than permuted-block randomization response-adaptive randomization , also known as outcome-adaptive randomization : the probability of being assigned to a group increases if the responses of the prior patients in the group were favorable on the other hand , a 2008 study of 146 meta-analysis concluded that the results of rcts with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the rcts ' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective for time-to-event outcome data that may be censored , survival analysis ( e.g for example , rcts may be stopped early if an intervention produces '' larger than expected benefit or harm '' , or if '' investigators find evidence of no important difference between experimental and control interventions a '' pure '' intention-to-treat analysis is '' possible only when complete outcome data are available '' for all randomized subjects ; when some outcome data are missing , options include analyzing only cases with known outcomes and using imputed data relative importance and observational studies two other lines of reasoning question rcts ' contribution to scientific knowledge beyond other types of studies : if study designs are ranked by their potential for new discoveries , then anecdotal evidence would be at the top of the list , followed by observational studies , followed by rcts . interpretation of statistical results to underscore the need for peer review and the danger of over-generalizing conclusions , two boston-area medical researchers performed a randomized controlled trial in which they randomly assigned either a parachute or an empty backpack to 23 volunteers who jumped from either a biplane or a helicopter sales of the drugs then decreased in 2002 and 2004 , however , published rcts from the women 's health initiative claimed that women taking hormone replacement therapy with estrogen plus progestin had a higher rate of myocardial infarctions than women on a placebo , and that estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy caused no reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease nevertheless , the return on investment of rcts may be high , in that the same study projected that the 28 rcts produced a '' net benefit to society at 10-years '' of 46 times the cost of the trials program , based on evaluating a quality-adjusted life year as equal to the prevailing mean per capita gross domestic product , a rare side effect of a drug ) would require rcts with extremely large sample sizes and may , therefore , best be assessed by observational studies . conflict of interest dangers of these , 318 rcts reported funding sources with 219 ( 69 % ) industry funded the authors concluded '' without acknowledgment of coi due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from rcts included in meta-analyses , readers ' understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised a 2004 study of 1999–2001 rcts published in leading medical and surgical journals determined that industry-funded rcts '' are more likely to be associated with statistically significant pro-industry findings '' these results have been mirrored in trials in surgery , where although industry funding did not affect the rate of trial discontinuation it was however associated with a lower odds of publication for completed trials between 1980 and 2016 , over 1,000 reports of rcts have been published another 2009 study randomized classrooms for 678 first-grade children to receive a classroom-centered intervention , a parent-centered intervention , or no intervention , and then followed their academic outcomes through age 19
