unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole wikipedia does n't have song lyrics , poetry , or fiction either ; it 's not a primary-source repository if someone offends you , we have some advice on staying cool when the editing gets hot please copy your good encyclopedic content from e2 to wikipedia ! do n't forget to search for related wikipedia content first & mdash ; like e2 , wikipedia has full-text search , and if wikipedia already has an article on the subject , just merge your own content into it : be bold ! mention on the wikipedia article 's talk page ( click '' discuss this page '' ) that you originally wrote the material for e2 and link to your e2 homenode ( like this : yerricde ) , so that nobody thinks you 're committing plagiarism though you can use html entity escapes for '' , '' , ' ' , you do n't need to ; wikipedia has the wi ki > tag to suppress interpretation of control characters as markup wikipedia has a different manual of style from e2 on e2 , noders will often quote from private messages sent by other noders in response to a writeup we have a policy called the neutral point of view ( npov ) it may take you a little time to get used to the wikipedia approach , but do n't worry too much about it of course , we would like to encourage you to post encyclopedic material here , and non-encyclopedic material elsewhere moving articles from wikipedia to e2 is very easy all you have to do is reformat the content appropriately ( e2 's text formatter makes it easy ) and follow the gnu free documentation license damian yerrick ( yerricde on e2 ) has provided an example of how to do this in his writeup in bullshit , which was derived from wikipedia 's article on bullshit e2 does not have formal policy , but one popular view holds that a writeup without attribution to another source carries an implicit claim that the user who posted the writeup is its author do not use this account to node your own material or to influence the e2 database by voting or using other features that one gains as one rises in level
