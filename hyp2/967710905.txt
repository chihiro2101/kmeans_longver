in some applications wall-clock time is used , in others the time encoded is a notional time with more arbitrary reference practical systems watch the ascending sequence of the timecode and infer the time of the current frame from that thus the ntsc color subcarrier ended up as 3.57954545 & nbsp ; mhz ( exactly & nbsp ; mhz ) , the line scan frequency as 15734.27 & nbsp ; hz ( exactly & nbsp ; mhz ) and the frame rate 29.97 & nbsp ; hz ( exactly & nbsp ; hz ) '' color television standards - selected papers and records of the ntsc '' edited by donald fink , mcgraw hill 1955 the altered frame rate meant that an '' hour of timecode '' at a nominal frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s , when played back at 29.97 & nbsp ; frame/s was longer than an hour of wall-clock time by 3.6 seconds , leading to an error of almost a minute and a half over a day in spite of what the name implies , no video frames are dropped or skipped when using drop-frame timecode for example , the sequence when frame counts are dropped : :01:08:59:28 :01:08:59:29 :01:09:00:02 :01:09:00:03 for each tenth minute :01:09:59:28 :01:09:59:29 :01:10:00:00 :01:10:00:01 while non-drop timecode is displayed with colons separating the digit pairs— '' hh : mm : ss : ff '' —drop-frame is usually represented with a semicolon ( ; ) or period ( studio operations and master clocks a frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s is often used for audio in america , japan , and other countries that rely on a 60 & nbsp ; hz mains frequency and use the ntsc television standard the advantage of vitc is that , since it is a part of the playback video , it can be read when the tape is stationary control track longitudinal timecode ( ctl timecode ) : smpte timecode embedded in the control track of a video tape film labels , such as keykode burnt-in timecode field dominance irig timecode linear timecode midi timecode rewritable consumer timecode vertical interval timecode
