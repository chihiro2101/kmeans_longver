in about 1150 , the birkenhead priory at birkenhead was established at this time , the mersey was considerably wider with sand dunes and marshes to the north leading up to ainsdale beach and sandstone cliffs and shorelines to the south near otterspool in 1330 , his son edward iii granted a charter to the priory and its successors for ever : '' the right of ferry there… for men , horses and goods , with leave to charge reasonable tolls '' the thieves were fined from the 16th to the 18th century ownership reverted to the crown , and in 1544 the ferry rights as well as the priory properties were bought by ralph worsley of lancashire for £586 6d ( current value - almost £205,000 ) the frequency depended on demand and the weather ferry services from rock house on the wirral – that is , rock ferry – were first recorded in 1709 the town of birkenhead was just starting to develop at this point the woodside , north birkenhead and liverpool steam ferry company was formed in 1835 , and the slipway at woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier it was rebuilt and extended in 1874 in 1894 trains were carrying 25,000 passengers per day and the ferries 44,000 per day the ferry service at tranmere , which had operated since mediaeval times , closed in 1897 the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry daffodil from wallasey to liverpool during the first world war the steamers iris and daffodil were taken out of service from wallasey to be used as troop ships in the zeebrugge raid in belgium the wallasey twin screw vessels all had flying bridges with port and starboard docking cabs wallasey ferries employed a funnel livery of white and black and birkenhead red and black when the queensway road tunnel opened in 1934 , the ferry service from seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry from woodside in 1941 and from seacombe 1947 the closure of eastham marked the last use of ferry paddle steamers on the river in 1950 , the ferries carried almost 30 million passengers a year , including 11 million on the woodside ferries and 15 million on seacombe ferries , but by 1970 the total number fell to 7 million during this period , maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably , with the woodchurch being laid up as a salvage for parts for mountwood and overchurch after the damaged helm was repaired , it was placed on woodchurch this has remained the case , even after both vessels were extensively rebuilt the ferries also began to operate summer manchester ship canal cruises , a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened , but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s . bus deregulation and the 1990 changes the morning peak service until 2010 ran every 30 minutes on a liverpool-birkehead-seacombe-liverpool circuit , but since then only runs every 20 minutes from liverpool-seacombe ferry and back the royal daffodil ii was hit by a bomb and sunk at her berth in the second world war , but later raised and returned to service , with little of her pre-war splendour she differed to all the other ferries as she had super smooth lines and a dummy funnel in place she is now berthed at woolwich , london attempts to bring her back to merseyside have come to nothing due to the prohibitive cost of making her fit for a 1,000 mile journey coastwise they only had one single boarding gangway and their forward saloons extended to the whole width of the ship similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the edmund gardner pilot boat at merseyside maritime museum the royal daffodil ii was constructed by james lamont and co the gross tonnage of royal daffodil ii was 609 aside from the engine order telegraphs , she also had helms in the side boxes meaning that the ship could be steered from them if required the roman ii was added to her name because of a thames estuary cruise ship also called royal daffodil which existed from 1939 until 1967 ( see mv royal daffodil ( 1939 ) ) the cause of the sinking was main engine and steering gear failure , and she claimed the lives of both her captain and mate mountwood , woodchurch and overchurch the mountwood was used in the film '' ferry cross the mersey '' , a musical and subsequent gerry & the pacemakers song , crossing to liverpool from birkenhead her passengers were rescued by woodchurch in 1962 , mountwood and woodchurch were joined by a new ferry , the overchurch the addition of a totally enclosed bridge meant that there only needed to be one binnacle upon it , whereas on the two sisters there were three , one inside the main wheelhouse and two in the docking/navigation boxes the overchurch also had much of its instrumentation fitted into specially built units , meaning the ferry had a spacious bridge , rather than the more compact and cluttered bridges of the mountwood and woodchurch she differed slightly by being a few tonnes heavier and a few inches longer she was not sold and after main engine repairs and a full repaint woodchurch returned to service in 1983 , freeing up overchurch to become the primary ferry to be used on a new otterspool service , set up for the 1984 international garden festival they also were given a new black and red livery replacing the red white and blue given for the garden festival season of 1984 the current two ferries have been in service for nearly 60 years and 2019 sees the 60th anniversary of the launching of royal iris of the mersey and the snowdrop the mersey ferries used to operate in fog , however currently the service is usually suspended when visibility is very poor sunday 20 july saw an unusual sight of all three ferries out on the river at night , with the snowdrop being berthed at woodside and the royal iris and royal daffodil at seacombe in december 2015 merseytravel announced a 20-year plan for the ferries which included the possible closure of one of the two wirral landing stages ( possibly woodside ) , a later start to commuter services which only operate from seacombe to liverpool , and one or two new vessels with better ability to hold social functions or musical events , a facility not available since the disposal of the 1951 royal iris '' ferry cross the mersey '' was a 1964 song , film , and soundtrack album in 1989 , a charity version of the song was recorded by liverpool artists the christians , holly johnson , paul mccartney , gerry marsden , and stock aitken waterman , and was released in aid of those affected by the hillsborough disaster
