there are three basic classes of bullets : those designed for maximum accuracy at varying ranges those designed to maximize damage to a target by penetrating as deeply as possible those designed to avoid over-penetration of a target , by deforming to control the depth to which the bullet penetrates , which as a by-product , deals more damage inside the wound the third class may limit penetration by expanding or fragmenting 32 s & w long wadcutter , these bullets are called wadcutters they have a very flat front , often with a relatively sharp edge along the perimeter the flat point punches a clean hole , and the shoulder opens the hole up cleanly research in the 1950s by the u.s the use of a wildcat based ( ultra ) long-range cartridge demands the use of a custom or customized rifle with an appropriately cut chamber and a fast-twist bore the jacket completely covers the front of the bullet , although often the rear is left with exposed lead ( this is a manufacturing consideration : the jacket is formed first , and the lead is swaged in from the rear ) military armor-piercing small arms ammunition is made from a copper-jacketed steel core ; the steel resists deformation better than the usual soft lead core leading to greater penetration many modern tank guns are smoothbore , not rifled , because practical rifling twists can only stabilize projectiles , such as an apcbc ( apcbc ) , with a length-to-diameter ratio of up to about 5:1 and also because the rifling adds friction , reducing the velocity and thus total force it is possible to achieve one of the hunting applications of the flat point bullet is large game such as bear hunted with a handgun in a 44 magnum or larger caliber these are designed to use the hydraulic pressure of muscle tissue to expand the bullet 44 magnum , for example , with an original weight of 240 grains ( 15.55 g ) and a diameter of 0.43 & nbsp ; inch ( 11 & nbsp ; mm ) might mushroom on impact to form a rough circle with a diameter of 0.70 & nbsp ; inch ( 18 & nbsp ; mm ) and a final weight of 239 grains ( 15.48 g ) 45 acp , as compared to the a larger diameter bullet is going to have significantly more drag than a smaller diameter bullet of the same mass , which means long range performance will be significantly degraded the common trade-off when comparing 40 s & w vs a 13- to 19-round capacity in the 9Ã—19mm especially where the military requirement of a nonexpanding round is concerned , there is fierce debate over whether it is better to have fewer , larger bullets for enhanced terminal effects , or more , smaller bullets for increased number of potential target hits also used are bullets similar to hollowpoint bullets or soft point bullets whose cores and/or jackets are deliberately weakened to cause deformation or fragmentation upon impact this does not violate the hague convention , as it specifically mentions bullets that expand or flatten in the body nato 7.62 & nbsp ; mm ball manufactured by some countries , such as germany and sweden , are also known to fragment due to jacket construction on impact , the epoxy shatters and the copper shell opens up , the individual lead balls then spread out in a wide pattern , and due to their low mass to surface area ratio , stop very quickly these bullets are usually restricted to pistol cartridges and rifle cartridges intended for use at very short ranges , as the nonhomogenous cores tend to cause inaccuracies that , while acceptable at short ranges , are not acceptable for the long ranges at which some rifles are used if a bomblet strikes an armoured vehicle , there is also a chance that the shaped charge will ( if used ) penetrate and disable the vehicle when used in the anti-tank role , a projectile that uses a shaped-charge warhead is known by the acronym heat ( high-explosive anti-tank ) tungsten and depleted uranium alloys are often used as the penetrator material file : russianwp.jpg wound ballistics for various soviet cartridges file : ak-47 7.62x39mm wound ballistics.gif ak-47 7.62x39mm wound ballistics file : ak-74 5.45x39mm wound ballistics.gif ak-74 5.45x39mm wound ballistics file : m16 5.56x45mm wound ballistics.gif m16 5.56x45mm wound ballistics file : m16a2 m855 5.56x45mm nato wound ballistics.gif m16a2 m855 5.56x45mm nato wound ballistics
