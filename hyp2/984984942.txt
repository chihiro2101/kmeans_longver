cell count remains the same for the life of the roll , while volume changes over time due to wear , plugging and damage contemporary ink metering systems employ a self contained system known as a chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll the other reverse angle blade works as previously described , removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll a 60 degree angle ensures maximum density in a given space low line numbers will allow for a heavy layer of ink to be printed , whereas high line numbers will permit finer detail in printing in virtually all printing applications with various print requirements , one volume will not print all to the highest quality there are many variables to consider when specifying an anilox roll beyond the print requirements , such as substrate , ink system , plate material , plate mounting tape , press speed , and drying capacity the best course of action is to consult suppliers of all these components for proper engraving specifications from their experience each specification has both a european standard and an american standard the european standard for transfer volume is cm³/m² or cubic centimetre per square meter , which means 1 cm³ of ink will be transferred onto 1 m² of paper this can be converted to cm³/m² by dividing by the density of the ink in g/cm³ this is because depending on the pattern used for the cell and depth of gravure of the anilox roll , the cell might contain higher or lower volumes of ink sri brochure ( pdf , 3.3 mb )
