the spacecraft were equipped with a dual bumper shield for dust protection from halley 's comet imaging system infrared spectrometer ultraviolet , light , infrared imaging spectrometer shield penetration detector dust detectors dust mass spectrometer neutral gas mass spectrometer apv-v plasma energy analyzer energetic-particle analyzer magnetometer wave and plasma analyzers the units were released some days before each arrived at venus and entered the atmosphere without active inclination changes the vega 1 lander 's surface experiments were inadvertently activated at from the surface by an especially hard wind jolt , and so failed to provide results the vega 2 lander touched down at 03:00:50 ut on 15 june 1985 at 8.5° s , 164.5° e , in eastern aphrodite terra a gondola assembly weighing and long was connected to the balloon envelope by a tether long the instruments consisted of : an arm carrying thin-film resistance thermometers and a anemometer they then floated upward a few kilometers to their equilibrium altitude the data intensive examination of the comet covered only the three hours around closest approach vega mission images from the space research institute ( iki ) raw data from vega 1 and vega 2 on board instruments soviet exploration of venus hsao/nasa astrophysics data system ( ads ) – a tool for studying atmosphere dynamics on venus
