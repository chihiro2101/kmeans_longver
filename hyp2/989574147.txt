hereby '' each diagram usually represents objects of a single class and track the different states of its objects through the system '' image : directed.svg 125px thumb a directed graph a classic form of state diagram for a finite automaton ( fa ) is a directed graph with the following elements ( q , σ , z , δ , q 0 , f ) : taylor booth ( 1967 ) sequential machines and automata theory , john wiley and sons , new york an edge is usually drawn as an arrow directed from the present state to the next state this mapping describes the state transition that is to occur on input of a particular symbol mcclusky , introduction to the theory of switching circuits , mcgraw-hill , 1965 the start state is not shown and must be inferred from the text accepting state ( s ) f : if used , for example for accepting automata , f ∈ q is the accept state for a deterministic finite automaton ( dfa ) , nondeterministic finite automaton ( nfa ) , generalized nondeterministic finite automaton ( gnfa ) , or moore machine , the input is denoted on each edge this designator will be written inside the state 's circle each edge is labeled with the input s 0 , s 1 , and s 2 are states science of computer programming , 8 ( 3 ) :231–274 , june 1987 with harel statecharts it is possible to model multiple cross-functional state diagrams within the statechart the harel statechart is equivalent to a state diagram but it improves the readability of the resulting diagram for example , there are tools for modeling and designing logic for embedded controllers atlanta , ga : acm since the program counter is the whole state , it follows that executing the command changed the state then between different program counter locations , not only does the program counter change , but variables might also change values , due to the commands executed in a loop ) , this does n't imply the program is in the same state the term '' unfolding '' originates from this multiplication of locations when producing the state graph from the program graph this results from the state being the program location ( here cycling ) combined with the counter value , which is strictly increasing ( until the overflow ) , so different states are visited in sequence , until the overflow
