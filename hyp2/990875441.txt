fields that employ the concept of taphonomy include : archaeobotany archaeology biology forensic science geoarchaeology geology paleoecology paleontology zooarchaeology there are five main stages of taphonomy : disarticulation , dispersal , accumulation , fossilization , and mechanical alteration floods , scavengers etc the outlines of megabiases in the fossil record , including the evolution of new bauplans and behavioral capabilities , and by broad-scale changes in climate , tectonics , and geochemistry of earth surface systems by coming to understand the oceanographic and ethology implications of observed taphonomic patterns , paleontologists have been able to provide new and meaningful interpretations and correlations that would have otherwise remained obscure in the fossil record archaeologists study taphonomic processes in order to determine how plant and animal ( including human ) remains accumulate and differentially preserve within archaeological sites eric delson and eric j '' archaeological and anthropological sciences 8 ( 2 ) : 343–351 knowledge gained from the past through these studies can be used to inform present and future decisions for human-environment interactions soft-bodied organisms may form 30 % to 100 % of the biota , but most fossil assemblages preserve none of this unseen diversity , which may exclude groups such as fungi and entire animal phyla from the fossil record among plants , anemophily species produce so much more pollen than zoophily species , the former being overrepresented relative to the latter characteristics of the habitat this is a particular problem in palynology like biases in spatial fidelity , there is a bias towards organisms that can survive reworking events , such as shells the silurian herefordshire lagerstätte ) gaps in time series such a hiatus is called an unconformity much of the incompleteness of the fossil record is due to the fact that only a small amount of rock is ever exposed at the surface of the earth , and not even most of that has been explored our fossil record relies on the small amount of exploration that has been done on this potential sources of bias include , search images : field experiments have shown that paleontologists working on , say fossil clams are better at collecting clams than anything else because their search image has been shaped to bias them in favour of clams relative ease of extraction : fossils that are easy to obtain ( such as many phosphatic fossils that are easily extracted en masse by dissolution in acid ) are overabundant in the fossil record the taphonomic pathways involved in relatively inert substances such as calcite ( and to a lesser extent bone ) are relatively obvious , as such body parts are stable and change little through time it was thought that only tough , cuticle type soft tissue could be preserved by burgess shale type preservation , but an increasing number of organisms are being discovered that lack such cuticle , such as the probable chordate pikaia and the shellless odontogriphus anoxia does , however , reduce the probability that scavengers will disturb the dead organism , and the activity of other organisms is undoubtedly one of the leading causes of soft-tissue destruction cambridge : cambridge university press , 1994 often these findings can be used to better understand cultural or environmental shifts within the present day
