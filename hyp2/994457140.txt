there are also now eight sharp and four flat major thirds 5-limit tuning yields a much larger number of wolf intervals with respect to pythagorean tuning , which can be considered a 3-limit just intonation tuning it is also important to note that the two fifths , three minor thirds , and three major sixths marked in orange in the tables ( ratio 40/27 , 32/27 , and 27/16 ( or g− , e♭− , and a+ ) , even though they do not completely meet the conditions to be wolf intervals , deviate from the corresponding pure ratio by an amount ( 1 syntonic comma , i.e five-limit tuning determines one diminished sixth of size 1024:675 ( about 722 cents , i.e 20 cents sharper than the 3:2 pythagorean perfect fifth ) this is also true for any perfect fourth or perfect fifth which slightly deviates from the perfectly consonant 4:3 or 3:2 ratios ( for instance , those tuned using 12-tone equal or quarter-comma meantone temperament ) the only solution is to make the number of dimensions match keep the piano keyboard because of the compromises ( and wolf intervals ) forced on meantone tunings by the one-dimensional piano-style keyboard , well temperaments and eventually equal temperament became more popular this howls far less acutely , but still very noticeably on an isomorphic keyboard , any given musical interval has the same shape wherever it appears — in any octave , key , and tuning — except at the edges because there is no b button , when playing an e power chord , one must choose some other note that is close in pitch to b , such as c , to play instead of the missing b listen to the two fifths here :
