image registration involves spatially transforming the source/moving image ( s ) to align with the target image knowing the correspondence between a number of points in images , a geometrical transformation is then determined to map the target image to the reference images , thereby establishing point-by-point correspondence between the reference and target images the first broad category of transformation models includes linear transformations , which include rotation , scaling , translation , and other affine transforms it is a part of the spm and air programs some of the feature matching algorithms are outgrowths of traditional techniques for performing manual image registration , in which an operator chooses corresponding control points ( cp ) in images affine ) for registration of the images frequency-domain methods find the transformation parameters for registration of the images while working in the transform domain multi-modality registration methods are often used in medical imaging as images of a subject are frequently obtained from different scanners manual , interactive , semi-automatic , and automatic methods have been developed cross-correlation , sum of squared intensity differences and ratio image uniformity are commonly used for registration of images in the same modality many new features have been derived for cost functions based on matching methods via large deformations have emerged in the field computational anatomy including measure matching which are pointsets or landmarks without correspondence , curve matching and surface matching via mathematical currents and varifolds , a statistics based approach to binary image registration with uncertainty analysis 1 , january 2007 domokos , c , parametric estimation of affine deformations of binary images image registration has applications in remote sensing ( cartography updating ) , and computer vision due to the vast range of applications to which image registration can be applied , it is impossible to develop a general method that is optimized for all uses
