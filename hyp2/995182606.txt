summary of the dialogue achilles grants the tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist when achilles demands that '' if you accept a and b and c , you must accept z , '' the tortoise remarks that that 's another hypothetical proposition , and suggests even if it accepts c , it could still fail to conclude z if it did not see the truth of : d : '' if a and b and c are true , z must be true '' the tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once achilles writes it down , but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows , since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true , z must be true : or , in words : proposition p ( is true ) implies q ( is true ) , and given p , therefore q the regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles , here modus ponens , and once that principle is explained , another principle is required to explain that principle within the system of propositional logic , no proposition or variable carries any semantic content bertrand russell discussed the paradox briefly in § 38 of the principles of mathematics ( 1903 ) , distinguishing between implication ( associated with the form '' if p , then q '' ) , which he held to be a relation between unasserted propositions , and inference ( associated with the form '' p , therefore q '' ) , which he held to be a relation between asserted propositions ; having made this distinction , russell could deny that the tortoise 's attempt to treat inferring z from a and b as equivalent to , or dependent on , agreeing to the hypothetical '' if a and b are true , then z is true deduction theorem homunculus argument münchhausen trilemma paradox regress argument rule of inference reprinted in the penguin complete lewis carroll ( harmondsworth , penguin , 1982 ) , pp 1104–1108 gödel , escher , bach
