his deep-chord monoplane wing was incorporated in the otherwise conventional junkers j 1 in december 1915 after the 1920s , soviet designers such as cheranovsky worked independently and in secret under stalin men like chizhevskij and antonov also came into the spotlight of the communist party by designing aircraft like the tailless bok-5 bok-5 , v.a.chizhevskij ( chizhevskij ) and oka-33 '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b shavrov , vol.1 pp in germany , alexander lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings , while the horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s the northrop n-1m , a scale prototype for a long-range bomber , first flew in 1940 '' the flying wing decades ahead of its time '' bbc news , 2 february 2016 several other late-war german military designs were based on the flying wing concept , or variations of it , as a proposed solution to extend the range of otherwise very short-range of aircraft powered by early jet engines the allies also made several relevant advances in the field first flown on 13 november 1947 , the a.w.52 yielded disappointing results ; the first prototype crashed without loss of life on 30 may 1949 , the occasion being the first emergency use of an ejection seat by a british pilot aviation author bill gunston referred to the bich-26 as being ahead of its time uçan kanat , thk basımevi , ankara , p early proposals for the avro vulcan , a nuclear-armed strategic bomber designed by roy chadwick , also explored several flying wing arrangements ; alliott verdon roe official web site - avro vulcan sketch one such configuration examined for the vulcan paired the flying wing with a rudimentary forward fuselage and a vertical stabilizer at each wingtip ; the delta wing that was actually adopted was arrived at by reducing the wingspan while maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips following the arrival of supersonic aircraft during the 1950s , military interest in the flying wing was quickly curtailed , as the concept of adopting a thick wing that accommodated the crew and equipment directly conflicted with the optimal thin wing for supersonic flight stealth technology relies on shapes that reflect radar waves only in certain directions , thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraft—a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves centennial of flight commission , 2003 retrieved : 5 november 2012 various prototype unmanned combat aerial vehicles ( ucavs ) have been produced , including the dassault neuron , the sukhoi s-70 okhotnik-b , and the bae systems taranis moreover , solutions may produce a final design that is still too unsafe for certain uses , such as commercial aviation pitch issues are discussed in the article on tailless aircraft a wing that is made deep enough to contain the pilot , engines , fuel , undercarriage and other necessary equipment will have an increased frontal area , when compared with a conventional wing and long-thin fuselage typically the solution adopted in this case is to keep the wing reasonably thin , and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters , pods , nacelles , fins , and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft it did not work well in practice in some flying wing designs , any stabilizing fins and associated control rudders would be too far forward to have much effect , thus alternative means for yaw control are sometimes provided an upper surface spoiler that also acts to reduce lift ( equivalent to deflecting an aileron upwards ) , so causing the aircraft to bank in the direction of the turn—the angle of roll causes the wing lift to act in the direction of turn , reducing the amount of drag required to turn the aircraft 's longitudinal axis
