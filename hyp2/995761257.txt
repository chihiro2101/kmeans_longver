in combining these two capabilities , however , the opteron earned recognition for its ability to run the vast installed base of x86 applications economically , while simultaneously offering an upgrade-path to 64-bit computing in particular , the opteron 's integrated memory controller allows the cpu to access local ram very quickly in april 2005 , amd introduced its first multi-core opterons at the time , amd 's use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core ; each physical opteron chip contained two processor cores amd 's model number scheme has changed somewhat in light of its new multicore lineup the 2000 series and 8000 series use socket f these cpus updated the multi-socket opteron platform to use ddr3 memory and increased the maximum hypertransport link speed from 2.40 & nbsp ; ghz ( 4.80 & nbsp ; gt/s ) for the istanbul cpus to 3.20 & nbsp ; ghz ( 6.40 & nbsp ; gt/s ) codenamed santa ana , rev amd introduced three quad-core opterons on socket am2+ for single-cpu servers in 2007 the socket am2+ quad-core opterons are code-named '' budapest socket am3+ was introduced in 2011 and is a modification of am3 for the bulldozer microarchitecture the “ lidded land grid array ” socket adds support for ddr2 sdram and improved hypertransport version 3 connectivity socket g34 ( lga 1944 contacts ) is one of the third generation of opteron sockets , along with socket c32 this socket supports magny-cours opteron 6100 , bulldozer-based interlagos opteron 6200 , and piledriver-based '' abu dhabi '' opteron 6300 series processors like socket g34 , socket c32 cpus will be able to use unbuffered ecc or non-ecc ram in addition to registered ecc sdram presently , only 2 ( dual-core , ddr2 ) , 3 ( quad-core , ddr2 ) and 4 ( six-core , ddr2 ) are used the first digit refers to the number of cpus in the target machine : 4 – designed for uniprocessor and dual-processor systems '' 1 '' refers to amd k10-based units ( magny-cours and lisbon ) , '' 2 '' refers to the bulldozer-based interlagos , valencia , and zurich-based units , and '' 3 '' refers to the piledriver-based abu dhabi , seoul , and delhi-based units official opteron homepage amd technical docs amd k8 opteron technical specifications amd k8 dual core opteron technical specifications interactive amd opteron rating and product id guide understanding the detailed architecture of amd 's 64 bit core comparison between xeon and opteron processor performance amd : dual-core opteron to 3 & nbsp ; ghz
