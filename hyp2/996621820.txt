the paradox follows from this analysis first , common natural-language proof techniques can be used to prove that the example sentence is true second , the truth of the example sentence can be used to prove that germany borders china therefore , in assuming a , we have assumed both a and '' if a , then b '' now , because we have proved '' if this sentence is true , then 'germany borders china ' is true '' , then we can again apply modus ponens , because we know that the claim '' this sentence is true '' is correct x : ( x → y ) x → x x → ( x → y ) x → y x y an alternative proof is via peirce 's law lambda terms describe values from the lambda calculus domain when translating expressions from mathematics to lambda calculus , the domain of lambda calculus terms is not always isomorphic to the domain of the mathematical expressions resolution in unrestricted languages for example , a natural language that allows the eval function is not mathematically consistent but each call to eval in that natural language may be translated into mathematics in a way that is consistent now attempt to instantiate the formula with ( x → y ) for a the order of the quantifiers may be reversed using skolemization : however , now instantiation gives which is not the starting point for the proof and does not lead to a contradiction resolution in set theory russell 's paradox girard 's paradox kleene–rosser paradox liar paradox list of paradoxes richard 's paradox zermelo–fraenkel set theory fixed-point combinator deductive lambda calculus let expression
