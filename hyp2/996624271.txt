galactic chart and hyperspace like the text-based star trek games , in star raiders the player 's ship maneuvers about a two-dimensional grid fighting a fleet of enemy spaceships flying about in the 3d view with the ship 's normal engines is sufficient for travel within a sector ; travel between sectors is via '' hyperspace '' , accomplished through an elaborate and noisy '' hyperwarp '' sequence with graphics loosely reminiscent of the star wars and star trek films in which the stars seemed to stretch to radial lines combat , damage and resources the most powerful zylon ship , the basestar , has a pulsating orange glow and resembles a cylon basestar any collision when shields are down destroys the ship and ends the game the rating depends on a formula involving the game play level , energy and time used , star bases destroyed ( both by player or the enemy ) , the number of enemies destroyed , and whether the player succeeded in destroying all enemies , was destroyed , or aborted ( quit or ran out of energy ) the mission wanting to make an action-oriented star trek-type game , doug neubauer designed star raiders in about eight to ten months while working for atari star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles enemy ships , shots , and most other moving objects use atari 's variant of hardware sprites , known as player-missile graphics , which have their own color registers independent of the current screen graphics mode the debris particles emitted when an enemy ship is destroyed are calculated as 3d points star raiders sounds of engines , shots , explosions , alarms , etc the entire game , code and data , fits into 8k ( 8192 bytes ) of rom , and requires only 8k of ram for its working data and display visuals ; thus it can run on any atari 8-bit computer in this version the zylons are renamed '' krylons '' the atari st version was designed and programmed by robert zdybel with graphics and animation by jerome domurat and released by atari corporation in 1986 just as the visicalc software has sold its share of atari 400 and 800 computers '' in 1983 the magazine 's readers named it '' the most popular atari program ever '' , with 65 % more weighted votes than second-place jawbreaker , and in 1984 they named the game the most popular atari program of all time the action is fast , the graphics are gorgeous , and i 've spent entirely too much time with it '' the enemies are now 3d wireframe ships instead of 2d sprites neubauer 's own solaris , for the atari 2600 , is both similar and in some ways more sophisticated than his earlier game , despite the difference in technology between the two systems star rangers , an homage to star raiders , was released in 2010 for the iphone
