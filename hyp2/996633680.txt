they are the subject of an avid community of key collectors this was to complete the electrical path to the next station so that its sounder would operate , as in the operator receiving a message from the next town the straight key is simple and reliable , but the rapid pumping action needed to send a string of dots ( or dits as most operators call them ) poses some significant drawbacks such problems can be avoided by using a good technique single paddle keys are also called single lever keys or sideswipers , the same name as the older side-to-side key design they greatly resemble for double-paddle keys , squeezing both paddles together makes a double-contact , which causes the keyer to send alternating dits and dahs an additional advantage of electronic keyers over semiautomatic keys is that code speed is easily changed with electronic keyers , just by turning a knob arduino cw keyer , k3ng if the dah lever is closed first , then the first element will be a dah , so the string of elements will be similar to a sequence of trochees in poetry and the method could as logically be called '' trochaic keying '' with a single-paddle or non-iambic keyer , the hand motion would require alternating four times for c ( dah-dit-dah-dit ) mode & nbsp ; a is the original iambic mode , in which alternate dots and dashes are produced as long as both paddles are depressed , a dot if the paddles were released during a dash , or a dash if the paddles were released during a dot typically , single and dual-paddle keys use horizontal movements , while a straight-key utilizes an up-and-down movement iambic keying â€“ debunking the myth , marshall g simple telegraph-like keys were long used to control the flow of electricity in laboratory tests of electrical circuits often , these were simple '' strap '' keys , in which a bend in the key lever provided the key 's spring action skinner at harvard university , the keys were mounted vertically behind a small circular hole about the height of a pigeon 's beak in the front wall of an operant conditioning chamber an operator 's style is known as their '' fist ''
