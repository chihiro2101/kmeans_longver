gradient , constriction , and obstruction are streambed topography factors and are relatively consistent this loss determines the river 's slope , and to a large extent its rate of flow ( velocity ) this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow the grade reflects both the technical difficulty and the danger associated with a rapid , with grade i referring to flat or slow-moving water with few hazards , and grade vi referring to the hardest rapids , which are very dangerous even for expert paddlers , and are rarely run a rapid 's grade is not fixed , since it may vary greatly depending on the water depth and speed of flow these objects can be very dangerous , because the force of the water will pin an object or body against the strainer and then pile up , pushing it down under water strainers are formed by many natural or man-made objects , such as storm grates over tunnels , trees that have fallen into a river ( '' log jam '' ) , bushes by the side of the river that are flooded during high water , wire fence , rebar from broken concrete structures in the water , or other debris strainers occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore , exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river and form strainers holes , or '' hydraulics '' , ( also known as '' stoppers '' or '' souse-holes '' ( see also pillows ) are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object , or underwater ledges , causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object holes can be particularly dangerous—a boater or watercraft may become stuck under the surface in the recirculating water—or entertaining play-spots , where paddlers use the holes ' features to perform various playboating moves ( even 'experts ' have died in them nfpa-1006 standard for technical rescuer this makes them challenging for boaters , since a strong sideways or diagonal ( also called a '' lateral '' ) wave can throw the craft off if the craft hits sideways or at an angle many whitewater deaths have occurred in this fashion undercuts are most common in rivers where the riverbed cuts through sedimentary rocks such as limestone rather than igneous rock such as granite of about nine people who have died at or near dimple rock , including three in 2000 , several of the deaths were the result of people becoming entrapped after they were swept under the rock similar to strainers , water is forced through the sieve , resulting in higher velocity flow , which forces water up and creates turbulence thumb people use many types of whitewater craft to make their way down a rapid , preferably with finesse and control kayaks are paddled in a low sitting position ( legs extended forward ) , with a two-bladed paddle rafts are also often used as a whitewater craft ; more stable than typical kayaks , they are less maneuverable they can either be paddled or rowed with oars oar-propelled catarafts have the occupants sitting on seats mounted on the frame this type of canoe is usually referred to simply as an '' open boat '' like kayaks , c1s can be righted after capsizing with an eskimo roll fluid dynamics and turbulence for an academic explanation of whitewater features list of whitewater rivers slalom canoeing river surfing
