bone is continually remodelled throughout the lifetime of an individual carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral ( hydroxylapatite ) , and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet it is also important for the researcher to know the variations of isotopes within individuals , between individuals , and over time particularly in the bronze age mediterranean , lead isotope analysis has been a useful tool for determining the sources of metals and an important indicator of trade patterns the ratio of the two isotopes may be altered by biological and geophysical processes , and these differences can be utilized in a number of ways by ecologists . stable isotope analysis in aquatic ecosystems parts per thousand differences from a standard , 13 c ) and r represents the ratio of the isotope of interest and its natural form ( e.g analysis of a sample can cost anywhere from 30 to 100 the transfer of 13 c through trophic levels remains relatively the same , except for a small increase ( an enrichment 13 c between animals indicate that they have different food sources or that their food webs are based on different primary producers ( i.e different species of phytoplankton , marsh grasses as the shrimp matured and migrated offshore , the isotopic values changed to those resembling offshore organisms ( δ 13 c -15‰ and δ 15 n 11.5‰ and δ 34 s 16‰ ) pelagic producers and marsh vs sulfur tends to be more plentiful in less aerobic areas , such as benthic systems and marsh plants , than the pelagic and more aerobic systems thus , organisms higher in the trophic pyramid have accumulated higher levels of 15 n ( and higher δ 15 n values ) relative to their prey and others before them in the food web numerous studies on marine ecosystems have shown that on average there is a 3.2‰ enrichment of 15 n vs as water travels from septic tanks to aquifers , the nitrogen rich water is delivered into coastal areas hydrogen isotope ratios in animal tissue reflect diet , including drinking water , and have been used to study bird migration and aquatic food webs hair has a recognisable growth rate of 9-11mm per month or 15 & nbsp ; cm per year most high explosives contain carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen and oxygen atoms and thus comparing their relative abundances of isotopes can reveal the existence of a common origin the same is applied to cocaine that is derived from bolivia and that from colombia in isotope hydrology , stable isotopes of water ( 2 h and 18 o ) are used to estimate the source , age , and flow paths of water flowing through ecosystems organisms such as foraminifera which combine oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water with carbon and calcium to build their shells therefore incorporate the temperature-dependent 18 o to 16 o ratio oxygen isotopes preserve a record of the effects of the milankovitch cycles on climate change during the quaternary , revealing an approximately 100,000-year cyclicity in the earth 's climate .
