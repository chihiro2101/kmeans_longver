this larger package was a compromise allowing intel to separate the secondary cache from the processor while still keeping it on a closely coupled back-side bus the intel pentium ii ( 'klamath ' ) cpu , tom 's hardware , march 1 , 1997 lal shimpi , anand intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the pentium ii , an area in which the pentium pro was at a notable handicap , by adding segment register caches most consumer software of the day was still using at least some 16-bit code , because of a variety of factors pc guide , accessed july 16 , 2016 general processor performance was increased while costs were cut intel 440lx , pcguide , accessed may 5 , 2007 however , these were not marketed in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , deschutes cpus are family 6 , model 5 and have the part number 80523 as noted in the pentium ii processor update documentation from intel , '' please note that although this processor has a cpuid of 163xh , it uses a pentium ii processor cpuid 065xh processor core later , in 1999 , the 0.25 ; 0.18 ( 400 & nbsp ; mhz ) μm dixon core with 256 & nbsp ; kb of on-die full speed cache was produced for the mobile market in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , dixon cpus are family 6 , model 6 and their intel product code is 80524 these identifiers are shared with the mendocino celeron processors mobile pentium ii l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency package : bga1 , mmc-1 , mmc-2 , μpga1 ppga-b615 mmx front-side bus : 66 , 100 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 1.5 , 1.55 , 1.6 , 2.0 & nbsp ; v process : 0.25 ; 0.18 ( 400 mhz ) & nbsp ; μm cmos first release : january 25 , 1999 clockrate : 266 , 300 , 333 , 366 , 400 & nbsp ; mhz containing 27.4 million transistors die size ( semiconductor chip ) is 10.36 & nbsp ; mm x 17.36 & nbsp ; mm 179.8496 & nbsp ; mm 2 list of intel pentium ii microprocessors intel celeron listing of various pii , piii , and celeron alphanumeric model designations cpu-info : intel pentium ii , indepth processor history construction analysis : intel 266mhz 32-bit pentium ii ( klamath ) processor , integrated circuit engineering corporation intel datasheets pentium ii ( klamath ) pentium ii ( deschutes ) mobile pentium ii ( tonga ) mobile pentium ii in micro-pga and bga packages ( dixon )
