calmodulin is structurally quite similar to troponin c , another ca 2+ -binding protein containing four ef-hand motifs importance of flexibility in calmodulin calmodulin ’ s ability to recognize a tremendous range of target proteins is due in large part to its structural flexibility these surfaces interact with complementary nonpolar segments on target proteins , typically consisting of groups of bulky hydrophobic amino acids separated by 10-16 polar and/or basic amino acids “ canonical ” targets of calmodulin , such as myosin light-chain kinases and camkii , bind only to the ca 2+ -bound protein , whereas some proteins , such as nav channels and iq-motif proteins , also bind to calmodulin in the absence of ca 2+ calmodulin mediates many crucial processes such as inflammation , metabolism , apoptosis , smooth muscle contraction , intracellular movement , short-term and long-term memory , and the immune response calmodulin can undergo post-translational modifications , such as phosphorylation , acetylation , methylation and proteolytic cleavage , each of which has potential to modulate its actions calmodulin plays an important role in excitation contraction coupling and the initiation of the cross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle , ultimately causing smooth muscle contraction the calcium channels , such as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum , can be inhibited by calmodulin bound to calcium , thus affecting the overall levels of calcium in the cell . role in short-term and long-term memory ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) plays a crucial role in a type of synaptic plasticity known as long-term potentiation ( ltp ) which requires the presence of calcium/calmodulin camkii contributes to the phosphorylation of an ampa receptor which increases the sensitivity of ampa receptors however , high calcium levels can be toxic to a plant 's cellular energy metabolism and , hence , the ca 2+ concentration in the cytosol is maintained at a submicromolar level by removing the cytosolic ca 2+ to either the apoplast or the lumen of the intracellular organelles plants contain cam-related proteins ( cmls ) apart from the typical cam proteins plant growth and development hence , cam is essential for the dwf1 function in plant growth s-locus receptor kinase ( srk ) is another protein kinase that interacts with cam dmi3 , an essential gene for nod factor signaling functions downstream of the ca 2+ spiking signature , might be recognizing the ca 2+ signature several cml genes in tobacco , bean and tomato are responsive to pathogens the cml43 from the apr134 also binds to ca 2+ ions in vitro which shows that cml43 and apr134 are , hence , involved in the ca 2+ -dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens therefore , external stress can affect plant growth and development and cam are involved in that pathway controlling this effect calmodulin 1 calm2 calm3 calm1p1 calml3 calml4 calml5 calml6
