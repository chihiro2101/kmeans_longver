in women and girls , antiandrogens are used to treat acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and hyperandrogenism antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls in accordance , therapeutic modalities that reduce androgen signaling in the prostate gland , referred to collectively as androgen deprivation therapy , are able to significantly slow the course of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile they are effective because androgens act as growth factors in the prostate gland systemic antiandrogens besides 5α-reductase inhibitors are not generally used to treat scalp hair loss in males due to risks like feminization ( e.g , gynecomastia ) and sexual dysfunction androgens increase sex drive , and for this reason , antiandrogens are able to reduce sex drive in men antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , gnrh modulators , spironolactone , bicalutamide , and ketoconazole . skin and hair conditions nonsteroidal antiandrogens like bicalutamide are also used for this indication these drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate , megestrol acetate , chlormadinone acetate , spironolactone , oxendolone , and osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide , topilutamide , enzalutamide , and apalutamide androgen synthesis inhibitors : drugs that directly inhibit the enzyme biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or dht antigonadotropins : drugs that suppress the gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) -induced release of gonadotropins and consequent activation of gonadal androgen production as another example , the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate and spironolactone possess off-target actions including progestogenic , antimineralocorticoid , and/or glucocorticoid activity in addition to their antiandrogen activity , and these off-target activities can result in additional side effects in contrast , spironolactone , enzalutamide , and other antiandrogens are not associated with significant rates of hepatotoxicity antiandrogens are relatively safe in acute overdose inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome p450 enzymes may interact with various antiandrogens in contrast , nonsteroidal ar antagonists are selective for the ar and have no off-target hormonal activity for this reason , they are sometimes described as '' pure '' antiandrogens although they are described as antiandrogens and indeed show only such effects generally , most or all steroidal ar antagonists are actually not silent antagonists of the ar but rather are weak partial agonists and are able to activate the receptor in the absence of more potent ar agonists like testosterone and dht in addition , whereas cyproterone acetate produces ambiguous genitalia via feminization in male fetuses when administered to pregnant animals , it has been found to produce masculinization of the genitalia of female fetuses of pregnant animals for example , although flutamide has about 10-fold lower affinity for the ar than cpa , it shows equal or slightly greater potency to cpa as an antiandrogen in bioassays these women have a 46 , xy karyotype ( i.e whereas conventional ar antagonists bind to the lbd of the ar and competitively displace androgens , thereby preventing them from activating the receptor , ar ntd antagonists bind covalently to the ntd of the ar and prevent protein–protein interactions subsequent to activation that are required for transcription ( biology ) they work by enhancing the degradation of the ar , and are analogous to selective estrogen receptor degraders ( serds ) like fulvestrant ( a drug used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer ) this process occurs mainly in the gonads and adrenal glands , but also occurs in other tissues like the prostate gland , skin , and hair follicles ketoconazole and abiraterone acetate are inhibitors of the enzyme cyp17a1 , also known as 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase , which is responsible for the conversion of pregnane steroids into androgens , as well as the conversion of mineralocorticoids into glucocorticoids in accordance , dht is involved in the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , and hirsutism , and 5α-reductase inhibitors are used to treat these conditions gonadotropins include luteinizing hormone ( lh ) and follicle-stimulating hormone ( fsh ) and are peptide hormones that signal the gonads to produce sex hormones gnrh modulators , including both gnrh agonists and gnrh antagonists , are powerful antigonadotropins that are able to suppress androgen levels by 95 % in men however , combined oral contraceptives that contain the particularly androgenic progestin levonorgestrel have been found to increase shbg levels by only 50 to 100 % , which is likely because activation of the ar in the liver has the opposite effect of estrogen and suppresses production of shbg ar antagonists were first discovered in the early 1960s however , spironolactone was introduced in 1959 , although its antiandrogen effects were not recognized or taken advantage of until later and were originally an unintended off-target action of the drug the nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide was first reported in 1967 & yoo , d for example , the progestogen and hence antigonadotropin medroxyprogesterone acetate is sometimes described as a steroidal antiandrogen , even though it is not an antagonist of the ar while effective in suppressing male fertility , their use as monotherapies is precluded by side effects , such as hypoandrogenism ( e.g the combination of a primary antigonadotropin such as cyproterone acetate to prevent fertility and an androgen like testosterone to prevent systemic androgen deficiency , resulting in a selective antiandrogenic action locally in the testes , has been extensively studied and has shown promising results , but has not been approved for clinical use at this time androgen insensitivity syndrome antiandrogens in the environment androgen replacement therapy
