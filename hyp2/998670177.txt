'' front-side buses usually connect the cpu and the rest of the hardware via a chipset , which intel implemented as a northbridge and a southbridge these secondary system buses usually run at speeds derived from the front-side bus clock , but are not necessarily synchronized to it prior to this announcement , made in spring 2007 at intel developer forum in beijing , intel had very closely guarded who had access to the fsb , only allowing intel processors in the cpu socket the first example was field-programmable gate array ( fpga ) co-processors , a result of collaboration between intel-xilinx-nallatech and intel-altera-xtremedata ( which shipped in 2008 ) often , these two buses must operate at the same frequency increasing the front-side bus to 450 & nbsp ; mhz in most cases also means running the memory at 450 & nbsp ; mhz a slow fsb will cause the cpu to spend significant amounts of time waiting for data to arrive from system memory in newer systems , the pci , agp , and pci express peripheral buses often receive their own clock signals , which eliminates their dependence on the front-side bus for timing overclocking is the practice of making computer components operate beyond their stock performance levels by manipulating the frequencies at which the component is set to run , and , when necessary , modifying the voltage sent to the component to allow it to operate at these higher frequencies more stably many motherboards allow the user to manually set the clock multiplier and fsb settings by changing jumpers or bios settings in a traditional architecture , the front-side bus served as the immediate data link between the cpu and all other devices in the system , including main memory many manufacturers publish the frequency of the front-side bus in mhz , but marketing materials often list the theoretical effective signaling rate ( which is commonly called megatransfers per second or mt/s )
