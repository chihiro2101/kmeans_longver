fehlner , francis p , ref.3 some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied in 1920 , ralph s lillie measured the effect of an active piece of iron touching a passive iron wire and found that '' a wave of activation sweeps rapidly ( at some hundred centimeters a second ) over its whole length '' in the late 1950s , atalla further discovered that the formation of a thermally grown sio 2 layer greatly reduced the concentration of surface states , and discovered the important quality of sio 2 films to preserve the electrical characteristics of pâ€“n junctions and prevent these electrical characteristics from deteriorating by the gaseous ambient environment oxide-passivation of silicon surfaces allowed diodes and transistors to be fabricated with significantly improved device characteristics , while the leakage path along the surface of the silicon was also effectively shut off atalla first published his findings in btl memos during 1957 , before presenting his work at an electrochemical society meeting in 1958 in solar cell technology , surface passivation is critical to solar cell efficiency in carbon quantum dot ( cqd ) technology , cqds are small carbon nanoparticles ( less than 10 & nbsp ; nm in size ) with some form of surface passivation aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation , which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments for example , prior to storing hydrogen peroxide in an aluminium container , the container can be passivated by rinsing it with a dilute solution of nitric acid and peroxide alternating with deionized water as the uncoated surface is water-soluble , a preferred method is to form manganese or zinc compounds by a process commonly known as parkerizing or phosphate conversion older , less-effective but chemically-similar electrochemical conversion coatings included black oxide , historically known as bluing or browning however , proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel , which is difficult to passivate , as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath these industry standards generally list several passivation processes that can be used , with the choice of specific method left to the customer and vendor various testing methods are available to determine the passivation ( or passive state ) of stainless steel chromate conversion coating ( chemical film ) per mil-dtl-5541f for aluminium and aluminium alloy parts a standard overview on black oxide coatings is provided in mil-hdbk-205 , phosphate & black oxide coating of ferrous metals
