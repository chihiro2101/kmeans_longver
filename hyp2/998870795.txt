in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction alternatively , invasive species can undergo population bottlenecks through founder events when introduced into their invaded range evolutionary genetics of invasive species trends in ecology & evolution , 17 ( 8 ) , 386-391 it is believed that additional bottlenecks must have occurred since homo erectus started walking the earth , but current archaeological , paleontological , and genetic data are inadequate to give much reliable information about such conjectured bottlenecks however , subsequent research , especially in the 2010s , appeared to refute both the climate argument and the genetic argument left a classic example of a population bottleneck is that of the northern elephant seal , whose population fell to about 30 in the 1890s although it now numbers in the hundreds of thousands , the potential for bottlenecks within colonies remains among the galápagos islands giant tortoises — themselves a prime example of a bottleneck — the comparatively large population on the slopes of the alcedo volcano is significantly less diverse than four other tortoise populations on the same island dna analyses date the bottleneck to around 88,000 years before present ( ybp ) the disappearance of a central population poses a major threat of population bottleneck this reduced genetic diversity in many crops could lead to broader susceptibility to new diseases or pests , which threatens global food security a population bottleneck was created in the 1970s through the conservation efforts of the endangered mauna kea silversword ( argyroxiphium sandwicense ssp
