both cores , produced on a 130 nanometer process , were first introduced on september 23 , 2003 like the opteron , on which it was based , the athlon fx-51 required buffered ram , increasing the final cost of an upgrade venice , the lower-end part , was produced for both sockets 754 and 939 , and included 512 & nbsp ; kb of l2 cache both were produced on the 90 & nbsp ; nm fabrication process released on may 31 , 2005 , it also initially had two different core revisions available to the public , manchester and toledo , the only appreciable difference between them being the amount of l2 cache both were released only for socket 939 some felt initially that the x2 would cause market confusion with regard to price points since the new processor was targeted at the same '' enthusiast , '' us 350 and above market already occupied by amd 's existing socket 939 athlon 64s an ocz unbuffered ddr2 kit , optimized for 64-bit operating systems , was released to exploit the functionality provided by the memory controller in socket am2 processors , allowing the memory controller to stay longer on the same page , thus benefitting graphics intensive applications . moving to the subnotebook space hardware-set permission levels make it much more difficult for malicious code to take control of the system the venice and san diego models also incorporate dual stress liner technology ( an amalgam of strained silicon and 'squeezed silicon ' , the latter of which is not actually a technology ) co-developed with ibm the athlon 64 fx is positioned as a hardware enthusiast product , marketed by amd especially toward gamers turion 64 ( formerly mobile athlon 64 ) since the t in the mt-30 is later in the alphabet than the l in ml-34 , the mt-30 consumes less power than the ml-34 the clock of the processors is significantly lower than desktop and other mobile counterparts to reach a low tdp , at 15w maximum for a single core x86-64 cpu at 1.6 & nbsp ; ghz the onboard memory controller was not capable of running unbuffered ( non-registered ) memory in dual-channel mode at the time of release ; as a stopgap measure , they introduced the athlon 64 on socket 754 , and brought out a non-multiprocessor version of the opteron called the athlon 64 fx , as a multiplier unlocked enthusiast part for socket 940 , comparable to intel 's pentium 4 extreme edition for the high end market in june 2004 , amd released socket 939 as the mainstream athlon 64 with dual-channel memory interface , leaving socket 940 solely for the server market ( opterons ) , and relegating socket 754 as a value/budget line , for semprons and slower versions of the athlon 64 in november 2006 , amd released a specialized version of socket f , called 1207 fx , for dual-socket , dual-core athlon fx processors on the quad fx platform athlon 64 fx models windsor ( 90 & nbsp ; nm soi ) dual-core cpu cpu-stepping : f2 , f3 l1-cache : 64 + 64 kb ( data + instructions ) , per core l2-cache : 512 - 1024 kb full speed , per core mmx , extended 3dnow ! , sse , sse2 , sse3 , amd64 , cool ' n'quiet , nx bit , amd-v socket am2 , 1000 & nbsp ; mhz hypertransport ( ht1000 ) vcore : 1.30 v - 1.40 v power consumption ( tdp ) : 125 watt max first release : may 23 , 2006 clockrate : 2000 & nbsp ; - & nbsp ; 3200 & nbsp ; mhz ( 6400+ ) , 2800 & nbsp ; mhz ( fx-62 ) windsor ( 90 & nbsp ; nm soi ) - quad fx platform clawhammer ( 130 & nbsp ; nm soi ) san diego ( 90 & nbsp ; nm soi ) athlon x2 dual core processor l335 generation : k8 65 & nbsp ; nm soi cpu-stepping : g2 l1-cache : 64 + 64 kb ( data + instructions ) l2-cache : ( 2 512 kb ) , full speed mmx , extended 3dnow ! , sse , sse2 , sse3 , amd64 , cool ' n'quiet , nx bit , amd-v asb1 package ( bga ) , 800 & nbsp ; mhz hypertransport ( ht800 ) power consumption ( tdp ) : 18 watt max powernow : yes clockrate : 1600 & nbsp ; mhz as of february 2012 , athlon64 x2 processors were still available for sale jim keller 64-bit list of amd athlon 64 microprocessors list of amd sempron microprocessors list of amd turion microprocessors
