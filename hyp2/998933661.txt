a major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire , i.e to bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality , husserl followed on brentano , and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention , both in continental and analytic philosophy other 20th-century philosophers such as gilbert ryle and a.j chisholm 's writings have attempted to summarize the suitable and unsuitable criteria of the concept since the scholastics , arriving at a criterion of intentionality identified by the two aspects of brentano 's thesis and defined by the logical properties that distinguish language describing psychological phenomena from language describing non-psychological phenomena this suggests that mary is either not thinking about something or that mary is thinking about something that does n't exist relationalists hold that having an intentional state involves standing in a relation to the intentional object relations are usually assumed to be existence-entailing : the instance of a relation entails the existence of its relata a similar solution replaces abstract objects with concrete mental objects as mary is thinking about superman , she is neither thinking about a platonic form outside space-time nor about a mental object another objection is that , by treating intentional objects as mere modifications of intentional states , adverbialism loses the power to distinguish between different complex intentional contents , the so-called many-property-problem from this thesis the following positions emerge : intentional idiom is problematic for science ; intentional idiom is not problematic for science , which is divided into : eliminative materialism ; epistemological realism ; quinean double standard ( see below ) which is divided into : adherence to normative principle ( epistemology ) , which is divided into : who makes an assumption of rationality ; who follows the principle of charity ; adherence to projective principle members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects , which may imply some kind of dualism ( though this is debatable ) quine ) or with the language of neuroscience ( e.g quine ( 1960 ) and wilfrid sellars ( 1958 ) both comment on this intermediary position humans , artifacts , non-human animals , etc ) should be the propositional attitude ( e.g an intentional state is transparent if it satisfies the following two conditions : ( i ) it is genuinely relational in that it entails the existence of not just the intender but the intendum as well , and ( ii ) substitutivity of identicals applies to the intendum ( i.e qualia theories , on the other hand , assert that among the phenomenal features of a mental state there are at least some non-intentional phenomenal properties , so-called '' qualia '' , which are not determined by intentional features they may argue , for example , that the difference in the last case also belongs to intentional content , because two different properties are ascribed to the apple : seen-roundness and felt-roundness ) another form of anti-intentionalism associated with john searle regards phenomenality itself as the '' mark of the mental '' and sidelines intentionality chisholm , roderick m chrudzimski , arkadiusz and barry smith ( 2004 ) '' brentano ’ s ontology : from conceptualism to reism '' in jacquette ( ed ) the cambridge companion to brentano davidson , donald synthese , xvii , pp dennett , daniel c '' the language of thought '' '' intentionality : transparent , translucent , and opaque '' & nbsp ; 283-302 , & baldwin , d intentions and intentionality : foundations of social cognition mohanty , jitendra nath ( 1972 ) de gruyter , berlin - boston , 2017 perler , dominik ( ed '' relativism , rationality , and the limits of intentional description '' pacific philosophical quarterly , 65 , pp & nbsp ; 211–35 amsterdam : rodopi , pp stanford encyclopedia of philosophy : intentionality intentionality in ancient philosophy consciousness and intentionality ancient theories of intentionality internet encyclopedia of philosophy : intentionality collective intentionality
