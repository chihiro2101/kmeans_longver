nevertheless , because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry , and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane , spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term '' line '' at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself higher-dimensional spherical geometries exist ; see elliptic geometry the book of unknown arcs of a sphere written by the islamic mathematician al-jayyani is considered to be the first treatise on spherical trigonometry euler , eléments de la trigonométrie sphéroïdique tirés de la méthode des plus grands et des plus petits , mémoires de l'académie des sciences de berlin 9 ( 1754 ) , 1755 , p & nbsp ; 31–54 ; opera omnia , series 1 , vol & nbsp ; 204–223 euler , trigonometria sphaerica universa , ex primis principiis breviter et dilucide derivata , acta academiae scientiarum imperialis petropolitinae 3 , 1782 , p each point is associated with a unique great circle , called the polar circle of the point , which is the great circle on the plane through the centre of the sphere and perpendicular to the diameter of the sphere through the given point as there are two arcs determined by a pair of points , which are not antipodal , on the great circle they determine , three non-collinear points do not determine a unique triangle two triangles with the same angle sum are equal in area two triangles with corresponding angles equal are congruent ( i.e , all similar triangles are congruent ) relation to euclid 's postulates if '' line '' is taken to mean great circle , spherical geometry obeys two of euclid 's postulates : the second postulate ( '' to produce extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line '' ) and the fourth postulate ( '' that all right angles are equal to one another '' ) for any positive value of f , this exceeds 180°
