the biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate ( gpp ) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( dmapp ) and isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) , catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase the α-terpinyl cation ( 5 ) then undergoes a 1,2 hydride shift via a wagner-meerwein rearrangement , leading to the formation of the terpinen-4-yl cation ( 6 ) finally , a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone ( 11-1 ) and β-thujone ( 11-2 ) absinthe : history in a bottle these effects are in line with other gaba antagonists the high dose had a short-term negative effect on attention performance thujone is reported to be toxic to brain , kidney , and liver cells and could cause convulsions if used in too high a dose a 2008 study of 13 pre-ban ( 1895–1910 ) bottles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( gc-ms ) found that the bottles had between 0.5 and 48.3 & nbsp ; mg/l and averaged 25.4 & nbsp ; mg/l absinthe myths finally laid to rest chemical composition of vintage preban absinthe with special reference to thujone , fenchone , pinocamphone , methanol , copper , and antimony concentrations a 2005 study recreated three 1899 high-wormwood recipes and tested with gc-ms , and found that the highest contained 4.3 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone maximum thujone levels in the eu are : regulation ( ec ) no 1334/2008 of the european parliament and council of 16 december 2008 , european commission food and drug administration ( 2003 ) department of the treasury alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau industry circular 2007-5 october 17 , 2007 for example , sage and sage oil ( which can be up to 50 % thujone ) are on the food and drug administration 's list of generally recognized as safe ( gras ) substances the individual liquor boards must approve each product before it may be sold on shelves 1 h nmr ( 500 mhz , cdcl 3 ) δ ppm 221.7 ( c o , c-3 ) , 47.5 ( ch , c-4 ) , 39.9 ( ch2 , c-2 ) , 33.1 ( ch , c-7 ) , 29.8 ( c , c-1 ) , 25.7 ( ch , c-5 ) , 20.1 ( ch3 , c-8 ) , 19.9 ( ch3 , c-8 ’ ) 18.9 ( ch3 , c-9 ) , 18.4 ( ch2 , c-6 )
