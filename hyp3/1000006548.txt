the project will allow users to navigate logically from the entire planet earth down into the ecozones and ecoregions , and their bordering rivers , seas , and oceans list of ecoregions in north america ( cec ) list of ecoregions in the united states ( epa ) for the wikidata page for each ecoregion , there should be complete coverage of some minimal data points : ecoregion name , realm , biome , countr ( ies ) , wwf id code , map , image , climate ( koppen ) , coordinates ( middle of the largest section ) if anyone wishes to identify a candidate for upgrading to feature status , it would be a great help to the project we can get a group of people helping there is no real standard , but readers probably want to know about : what species are characteristic of the area what species are notable for the area what species are of conservation interest ( threatened , endangered , vulnerable , endemic ) address plants , mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians , fish describe the character of the habitats ( types of forest , desert , etc should also refer to ecoregions when describing their range wwf databases include terrestrial and marine ecoregions , as well as thousands of species distributions in terms of ecoregions issue 1 : the main map is '' fair use '' : could we ask for it , might we just put a link to it ? issue 2 : the main map is not precise enough to easily find references of soil types for each ecoregion a major difference with usda soil taxonomy is that soil-related climate regimes , such as xeric , ustic , and udic , are not part of the system , except insofar as climate influences soil profile characteristics ( see climate ) the atlas of global conservation from the nature conservancy has various statistics for all the wwf ecoregions , valid add the template your user page the name of the ecoregion the countries it covers physical area of the ecoregion , in square kilometers and square miles the ecozone and bioregion in which it is contained the zoogeographic region or regions it is a part of the origins of the fauna , and the faunal affiliations with and distinctions from with neighboring ecoregions the resources of the ecoregion : agriculture , fishing , timber , mining , industry deforestation , soil degradation , and desertification project members should assess articles according to the importance and quality scales given at wikipedia : wikiproject ecoregions/assessment , and then record the results using the project template on the article talk page user:1brettsnyder - i have created several ecoregion articles and will continue to do so , as well as improve any and all ecoregion articles i find lacking quinobi 20:55 , 14 jun 2005 ( utc ) -- bcasterline • talk 04:37 , 1 june 2006 ( utc ) despite obvious inactivity i am a coordinator of wp : desert région écologique écozone écodistrict classification écologique des terres wikiproject watchlist - wikiproject ecoregions
