rubrum is usually easy to identify , it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics generally the crown is irregularly ovoid with ascending whip-like curved shoots they are typically long and wide with 3-5 palmate lobes with a serrated margin the upper side of a soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red the buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color , generally with several loose scales the buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint under the proper conditions , the tree can sometimes switch from male to female , male to hermaphroditic , and hermaphroditic to female the staminate flowers are sessile the pistillate flowers are borne on pedicels that grow out while the flowers are blooming , so that eventually the flowers are in a hanging cluster with stems long the staminate flowers contain between 4 and 12 stamens , often with 8 after they reach maturity , the seeds are dispersed for a 1 to 2 week period from april through july it grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks : granite , gneiss , schist , sandstone , shale , slate , conglomerate , quartzite , and limestone chlorosis can occur on very alkaline soils , though otherwise its ph tolerance is quite high moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds , & miller , k.v forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses champaign , il : kings time printing at the same time , they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve , even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks a tree in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application however , one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy trees growing in a zone 9 or 10 area such as florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north , for instance to canada , maine , vermont , new hampshire and new york , even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples generally speaking , individuals from the north flush the earliest , have the most reddish fall color , set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury red maple frequently hybridizes with silver maple ; the hybrid , known as freeman 's maple , acer × freemanii , is intermediate between the parents the ingestion of 700 & nbsp ; grams ( 1.5 pounds ) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms ( 3 pounds ) is lethal treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach , as well as blood transfusions , fluid support , diuretics , and anti-oxidants such as vitamin c about 50 % to 75 % of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result red maple 's rapid growth , ease of transplanting , attractive form , and value for wildlife ( in the eastern us ) has made it one of the most extensively planted trees the tree was introduced into the united kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation forming an association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can help a 'autumn blaze ' – rounded oval form with leaves that resemble the silver maple 'autumn spire ' – broad columnar crown ; red fall color ; very hardy 'gerling ' – a compact , slow growing selection , this individual only reaches and has orange-red fall foliage 'northwood ' – branches are at a 45 degree angle to the trunk , forming a rounded oval crown this cultivar has gained the royal horticultural society 's award of garden merit 'shade king ' – this fast growing cultivar has an upright-oval form with deep green summer leaves that turn red to orange in fall however , the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple , and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes , imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup they also would brew tea from the inner bark to treat coughs and diarrhea
