3 : shell and tube heat exchanger , 2-pass shell side , 2-pass tube side ( 2-2 countercurrent ) there are three primary classifications of heat exchangers according to their flow arrangement on the other hand , their low efficiency coupled with the high space occupied in large scales , has led modern industries to use more efficient heat exchangers like shell and tube or plate ( b ) parallel flow , where at the same point , the hot and cold liquids join , flow in the same direction and exit at the same end the figure above illustrates the parallel and counter-flow flow directions of the fluid exchanger if this is done under comparable conditions , more heat is transferred to the counter-flow device than to the parallel flow heat exchanger there is many various kinds of baffles , and the choice of baffle form , spacing , and geometry depending on the allowable flow rate of the drop in shell-side force , the need for tube support , and the flow-induced vibrations plates are produced in different depths , sizes and corrugated shapes there is different type of plates available which includes plate and frame , plate and shell and spiral plate heat exchangers condensers are instruments that take and cool hot gas or vapor to the point of condensation and transform the gas into a liquid form furthermore , boilers are categorized as initial application of heat exchangers the word steam generator was regularly used to describe a boiler unit where a hot liquid stream is the source of heat rather than the combustion products depending on the dimensions and configurations the boilers are manufactured a set of tubes is called the tube bundle and can be made up of several types of tubes : plain , longitudinally finned , etc shell and tube heat exchangers are typically used for high-pressure applications ( with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260 & nbsp ; °c ) new york : longman scientific and technical a larger tube pitch leads to a larger overall shell diameter , which leads to a more expensive heat exchanger the most common type of baffle is the segmental baffle an outer , wider baffle looks like a doughnut , whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk ( see : copper in heat exchangers ) in hvac applications , large heat exchangers of this type are called plate-and-frame ; when used in open loops , these heat exchangers are normally of the gasket type to allow periodic disassembly , cleaning , and inspection some plates may be stamped with '' chevron '' , dimpled , or other patterns , where others may have machined fins and/or grooves a third and important difference is that plate exchangers employ more countercurrent flow rather than cross current flow , which allows lower approach temperature differences , high temperature changes , and increased efficiencies a third type of heat exchanger is a plate and shell heat exchanger , which combines plate heat exchanger with shell and tube heat exchanger technologies adiabatic wheel heat exchanger after welding the enclosed space is pressurised with sufficient force to cause the thin metal to bulge out around the welds , providing a space for heat exchanger liquids to flow , and creating a characteristic appearance of a swelled pillow formed out of metal waste heat recovery units the hot gas stream can be the exhaust gas from a gas turbine or a diesel engine or a waste gas from industry or refinery an organic rankine cycle ( orc ) waste heat recovery unit can be more efficient at low temperature range using refrigerants that boil at lower temperatures than water this fluid is expanded in the turbine to convert thermal energy to kinetic energy , that is converted to electricity in the electrical generator another type of heat exchanger is called '' dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger '' power plants that use steam-driven turbines commonly use heat exchangers to boil water into steam this is usually a solid to liquid phase due to the small volume difference between these states one example where this has been investigated is for use in high power aircraft electronics ( 1983 ) , chemical engineering – design ( si units ) , volume 6 , pergamon press , oxford and richardson , j ( 1999 ) chemical engineering- fluid flow g.f.hewitt , g.l.shires , t.r.bott ( 1994 ) process heat transfer , crc press , inc , united states of america
