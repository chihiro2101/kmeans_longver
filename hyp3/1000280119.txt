the first known idea for a guided surface-to-air missile was in 1925 , when a beam riding system was proposed whereby a rocket would follow a searchlight beam onto a target this potential was already obvious by 1942 , when walther von axthelm outlined the growing problems with flak defences that he predicted would soon be dealing with '' aircraft speeds and flight altitudes that will gradually reach and between by this point serious studies by the peenemünde team had been prepared , and several rocket designs had been proposed , including 1940 's feuerlilie , and 1941 's wasserfall and henschel hs 117 schmetterling as the urgency of the problem grew , new designs were added , including enzian and rheintochter , as well as the unguided taifun which was designed to be launched in waves , raf museum in general , these designs could be split into two groups one set of designs would be boosted to altitude in front of the bombers and then flown towards them on a head-on approach at low speeds comparable to manned aircraft some extreme fighter designs , like the komet and natter , also overlapped with sams in their intended uses the british developed unguided antiaircraft rockets ( operated under the name z battery ) close to the start of world war ii , but the air superiority usually held by the allies meant that the demand for similar weapons was not as acute these weapons were released from stand-off distances , with the bomber remaining outside the range of the ship 's antiaircraft guns , and the missiles themselves were too small and fast to be attacked effectively this led to the british fairey stooge and brakemine efforts , flight 1947 , p.345 and the u.s navy 's sam-n-2 lark taylor 1975 , p.45 bill gunston , rockets & missiles , salamander books , 1979 , p the illustrated encyclopedia of 20th century weapons and warfare vol 1175–1176 , general editor bernard fitzsimons , purnell & sons ltd two competing designs were proposed for '' stage 1 '' , based on common radar and control units , and these emerged as the raf 's bristol bloodhound in 1958 , '' bloodhound : the sagw system of the royal air force '' , flight international , 23 october 1959 , pp it would also be the first and only time that the latest and most modern air defense technologies of the soviet union and the most modern jet fighter planes and bombers of the united states confronted each other in combat aircraft from 20 engagements marshall michel , '' the christmas bombing '' , air and space , january 2001 by the conclusion of the linebacker ii campaign , the shootdown rate of the s-75 against the b-52s was 7.52 % ( 15 b-52s were shot down , 5 b-52s were heavily damaged for 266 missiles ) zaloga , steven j 22 during the war , the soviet union supplied 7,658 sams to north vietnam , and their defense forces conducted about 5,800 launches , usually in multiples of three by the war 's end , the u.s lost 3,374 aircraft in combat subsequently , this b-52 was counted as '' crashed in flight accidents '' shorter ranges meant the missiles could be much smaller , which aided them in terms of mobility examples include the 2k12 kub ( sa-6 ) and 9k33 osa ( sa-8 ) , mim-23 hawk , rapier , roland and crotale the performance gap between this weapon and jet fighters of the post-war era was so great that such designs would not be effective mobility , maneuverability and range modern long-range weapons include the patriot and s-300 ( missile ) systems , which have effective ranges on the order of 150 & nbsp ; km , and offer relatively good mobility and short unlimbering times once a major group onto itself , medium-range designs have seen less development since the 1990s , as the focus has changed to unconventional warfare these have the advantage of being '' fire-and-forget '' , once launched they will home on the target on their own with no external signals needed systems combining an infrared seeker as a terminal guidance system on a missile using sarh are also known , like the mim-46 mauler , but these are generally rare while iff is not as important with manpads , as the target is almost always visually identified prior to launch , most modern manpads do include it long-range systems generally use radar systems for target detection , and depending on the generation of system , may '' hand off '' to a separate tracking radar for attack list of surface-to-air missiles anti-aircraft warfare man-portable air-defense systems missile guidance list of nato reporting names for surface-to-air missiles list of missiles list of anti-aircraft weapons suppression of enemy air defenses ( sead ) , the mission of finding and destroying sam and aa gun installations ; notes ; citations ; bibliography davies , peter michel iii , marshal l все считали , что такого не могло быть никогда óêðà¿íñüêà ñï³ëêà âåòåðàí³â àôãàí³ñòàíó ( âî¿í³â-³íòåðíàö³îíàë³ñò³â ) - âüåòíàì
