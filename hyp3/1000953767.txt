patent 716,134 ) and lee de forest in 1904 ( u.s patent 771,819 ) , among many other examples for longwave use , this resulted in loop antennas tens of feet on a side , often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal another solution to this problem was developed by the marconi company in 1905 this led to the 1919 introduction of the adcock antenna ( uk patent 130,490 ) , which consisted of four separate monopole antennas instead of two loops , eliminating the horizontal components and thus filtering out the sky waves being reflected down from the ionosphere the us army air corps in 1931 tested a primitive radio compass that used commercial stations as the beacon '' broadcast station can guide flyer '' , april 1931 , popular science a major improvement in the rdf technique was introduced by robert watson-watt as part of his experiments to locate lightning strikes as a method to indicate the direction of thunderstorms for sailors and airmen development was limited until the mid-1930s , when the various british forces began widespread development and deployment of these '' high-frequency direction finding '' , or '' huff-duff '' systems in particular , the ability to compare the phase of signals led to phase-comparison rdf , which is perhaps the most widely used technique today other systems have been developed where more accuracy is required in use , the rdf operator would first tune the receiver to the correct frequency , then manually turn the loop , either listening or watching an s meter to determine the direction of the null ( the direction at which a given signal is weakest ) of a long wave ( lw ) or medium wave ( am ) broadcast beacon or station ( listening for the null is easier than listening for a peak signal , and normally produces a more accurate result ) while this information provided a baseline from the station to the ship or aircraft , the navigator still needed to know beforehand if he was to the east or west of the station in order to avoid plotting a course 180-degrees in the wrong direction usage in maritime and aircraft navigation since these radio signals are broadcast in all directions ( omnidirectional ) during the day , the signal itself does not include direction information , and these beacons are therefore referred to as non-directional beacons , or ndbs siderea , 1985 v dello stato , 1950 musella , francesco , il radiogoniometro ed il radiofaro nella navigazione , roma , ist direzione superiore del servizio studi ed esperimenti del genio , milano , tip toffaloni , 1942 21 : il radiogoniometro marconi per stazioni terrestri : tipo 12 a , roma , ufficio marconi , 1923 tosi , a radio , 1923 radiogoniometro marconi r : g istruzioni per l'uso e la manutenzione del segnale d'allarme automatico senza regolaggio tipo s r , roma , ist marconi , 1949 radiogoniometro indicatore di rotta tipo p 63 n : descrizione ed istruzioni per l'uso , ministero dell'aeronautica , divisione generale delle costruzioni e degli approvvigionamenti , milano , toffaloni , 1941 impiego pratico del radiogoniometro d.f.m.3 sulle navi mercantili , ministero delle comunicazioni , direzione generale delle poste e dei telegrafi , roma , ist & nbsp ; 213â€“262
