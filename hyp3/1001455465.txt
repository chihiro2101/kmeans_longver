a theory exists ( though it is somewhat controversial ) that a corruption of this name used by the romans became hispania , the latin name for the iberian peninsula in the british isles , these preserves were known as warrens or , and rabbits were known as , to differentiate them from the similar hare a warrener was responsible for controlling poachers and other predators and would collect the rabbits with snares , nets , hounds ( such as greyhounds ) , or by hunting with ferrets the practice of rabbit domestication also came from rome individual boxes or burrow-spaces could line the wall some of these strains remain as regional breeds , such as the gotland of sweden , while others , such as the land kaninchen , a spotted rabbit of germany , have become extinct . expansion around the globe the criollo rabbit comes from mexico with the rise of scientific animal breeding in the late 1700s , led by robert bakewell ( among others ) , distinct livestock breeds were developed for specific purposes ( for comparison , the average daily wage at the time was approximately 1 such organizations and associations were also established across europe & mdash ; most notably in germany , france , and scandinavia & mdash ; allowing for the recognition of local breeds ( many of which shared similar characteristics across national borders ) and for the preservation of stock during disruptions such as world wari and world warii traits common to many popular pet breeds are small size , '' dwarf '' ( or neotenic ) features , plush or fuzzy coats , and an array of coat colors and patterns meanwhile , rabbit raising for local markets gained prominence in developing nations as an economical means of producing protein sub-par or '' cull '' animals from other breeding goals ( laboratory , exhibition , show , wool , or pet ) may also be used for meat , particularly in smallholder operations counterintuitively , the giant rabbit breeds are rarely used for meat production , due to their extended growth rates ( which lead to high feed costs ) and their large bone size ( which reduces the percentage of their weight that is usable meat ) in contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations , breeds such as the new zealand and the californian , along with hybrids of these breeds , are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries rabbit breeding stock raised in france is particularly popular with meat rabbit farmers internationally , some being purchased as far away as china in order to improve the local rabbit herd current practices include the option of re-breeding the doe within a few days of delivery ( closely matching the behavior of wild rabbits during the spring and early summer , when forage availability is at its peak ) this can result in up to eight or more litters annually ) dark fryers are also harder to de-hide ( skin ) than white fryers in europe , however , a sizable market remains for the dark fryers that come from older and larger rabbits in 1990 , the world 's annual production of rabbit meat was estimated to be 1.5 million tons . wool rabbits and pelt rabbits rabbit wool , generically called angora , is 5 times warmer than sheep 's wool a number of rabbit breeds have been developed with the fur trade in mind left rabbits have been and continue to be used in laboratory work such as production of antibodies for vaccines and research of human male reproductive system toxicology modern methods for housing domestic rabbits vary from region to region around the globe and by type of rabbit , technological or financial opportunities and constraints , intended use , number of animals kept , and the particular preferences of the owner or farmer not all of these goals are

the practice of confining the rabbits to a moveable cage with an open or slatted floor so that the rabbits can access grass but still be kept at hand and protected from weather and predators challenges to successful production rabbits kept indoors at an appropriate temperature rarely suffer heat loss compared to rabbits housed outdoors in summer production does on fodder are rarely able to raise more than 3 litters a year without heavy losses from deaths of weak kits , abortion , and fetal resorption , all related to poor nutrition and inadequate protein intake what became known as the '' belgian hare boom '' began with the importation of the first belgian hares from england in 1888 and soon after the founding of the first rabbit club in america , the american belgian hare association today , the belgian hare is considered one of the rarest breeds , with less than 200 in the united states as reported in a recent survey showing rabbits is an increasingly popular activity children 's clubs such as 4h also include rabbit shows , usually in conjunction with county fairs the arba holds an annual national convention which has as many as 25,000 animals competing from all over the world the mitochondrial dna has also been sequenced in 2011 , parts of the rabbit genome were re-sequenced in greater depth in order to expose variation within the genome the format is gene1—distance—gene2 there are 11 color gene groups ( or loci ) in rabbits they are a , b , c , d , e , en , du , p , si , v , and w each locus has dominant and recessive genes these include the rufous modifiers , color intensifiers , and plus/minus ( blanket/spot ) modifiers the genes are : a : agouti ( '' wild color '' or chestnut agouti , opal , chinchilla , etc the genes are : b : black ( chestnut agouti , black otter , black ) b : brown ( chocolate agouti , chocolate otter , chocolate ) '' c '' represents the color locus when it is recessive , it removes most black pigment it is incompletely dominant and results in three possible color patterns : enen : '' charlie '' or a lightly marked broken with color on ears , on nose , and sparsely on body enen : '' broken '' with roughly even distribution of color and white enen : solid color with no white areas '' du '' represents the dutch color pattern ( the front of the face , the front part of the body , and rear paws are white ; the rest of the rabbit has colored fur ) v : vienna white ( blue-eyed white or bew ) '' si '' represents the silver locus the genes are : w : normal width of yellow band w : doubles yellow bandwidth ( otter becomes tan , intensified red factors in thrianta and belgian hare ) '' p '' represents the oca type ii form of albinism the genes are : p : normal color p : albinism mutation removes eumelanin and causes pink eyes
