kostrikin was able to prove in 1958 that among the finite groups with a given number of generators and a given prime exponent , there exists a largest one therefore , we pose more requirements on g burnside problem for groups with bounded exponent asks : burnside problem if g is a finitely generated group with exponent n , is g necessarily finite ? it turns out that this problem can be restated as a question about the finiteness of groups in a particular family , x m and the relations x n 1 for each word x in x 1 , thus if g is any finitely generated group of exponent n , then g is a homomorphic image of b ( m , n ) , where m is the number of generators of g burnside considered some easy cases in his original paper : b ( 1 , n ) is the cyclic group of order n the breakthrough in solving the burnside problem was achieved by pyotr novikov and sergei adian in 1968 the case of even exponent turned out to be considerably more difficult this was improved in 1996 by i lysënok to m > 1 and n ≥ 8000 in a paper published in 1996 , ivanov and ol'shanskii solved an analogue of the burnside problem in an arbitrary hyperbolic group for sufficiently large exponents let m be the intersection of all subgroups of the free burnside group b ( m , n ) which have finite index , then m is a normal subgroup of b ( m , n ) ( otherwise , there exists a subgroup g −1 mg with finite index containing elements not in m ) kostrikin during the 1950s , prior to the negative solution of the general burnside problem
