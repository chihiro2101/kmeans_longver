the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature , show a warming of 0.85 0.65 to 1.06 °c , in the period 1880 to 2012 , based on multiple independently produced datasets land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures ipcc ar5 wg1 chapter 2 page 187 and page 192 for 1979 to 2012 , the linear warming trend for combined land and sea temperatures has been 0.155 & nbsp ; °c ( 0.122 to 0.188 & nbsp ; °c ) per decade , according to ar5 this marked the third consecutive year reaching a new record temperature , the first time since the current warming trend began in the 1970s that three years in a row were record highs '' tim osborn , director of research at the university of east anglia 's climatic research unit , agreed stating that '' multiple lines of independent evidence confirm that the planet has warmed over the last 150 years : warmer oceans , warmer land , warmer lower atmosphere and melting ice greenhouse gases trap outgoing radiation warming the atmosphere which in turn warms the land there are several other effects such as clouds records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures . website curator : schmunk , r.b the period for which reasonably reliable instrumental records of near-surface temperature exist with quasi-global coverage is generally considered to begin around 1850 the methods used to derive the principal estimates of global surface temperature trends—hadcrut3 , noaa and nasa/giss—are largely independent other reports and assessments bush , and in later publications , has strongly endorsed evidence of an average global temperature increase in the 20th century how much did they come after you ? i actually do n't like the word '' skeptics '' for them ; i think it 's better to call them '' contrarians , '' because skepticism is part of science ; all scientists are skeptics ( . internal climate variability and global warming one of the issues that has been raised in the media is the view that global warming '' stopped in 1998 '' internal climate variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system , such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean an example of internal climate variability is the el niño–southern oscillation ( enso ) the el niño in 1998 was particularly strong , possibly one of the strongest of the 20th century cooling between 2006 and 2008 , for instance , was likely driven by la niña , the opposite of el niño conditions ( direct link to image ) warming is strongest over inland areas in asia and north america as well as south-eastern brazil and some areas in the south atlantic and indian oceans seasonal temperature trends are positive over most of the globe but weak cooling is observed over the mid latitudes of the southern ocean but also over eastern canada in spring because of strengthening of the north atlantic oscillation there is no fundamental inconsistency among these model results and observations at the global scale national weather service cooperative observer program has established minimum standards regarding the instrumentation , siting , and reporting of surface temperature stations karl , susan j indiana state climate office a 2006 study analyzed 366 u.s
