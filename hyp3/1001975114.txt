for the nexus switches cisco developed nx-os , which is similar to ios , except that it is linux-based all commands are assigned a privilege level , from 0 to 15 , and can only be accessed by users with the necessary privilege the disadvantage of the ios architecture is that it increases the complexity of the operating system , data corruption is possible as one process can write over the data of another , and one process can destabilize the entire operating system or even cause a software-forced crash this is processed to generate the final ip forwarding table ( fib , forwarding information base ) , which is used by the forwarding function of the router an interface descriptor block , or simply idb , is a portion of memory or cisco ios internal data structure that contains information such as the ip address , interface state , and packet statistics for networking data information about the ios version and feature-set running on a cisco device can be obtained with the show version command unified comms adds features like callmanager express , gatekeeper , h.323 , ip slas , mgcp , sip , voip , cube ( sbc ) ios images can not be updated with software bug fixes b is the minor version number e ( zero , one or two letters ) is the software release train identifier , such as none ( which designates the mainline , see below ) , t ( for technology ) , e ( for enterprise ) , s ( for service provider ) , xa as a special functionality train , xb as a different special functionality train , etc the cisco advisory web site may list more than one possible interim to fix an associated issue ( the reason for this is unknown to the general public ) before cisco ios release 15 , releases were split into several trains , each containing a different set of features updates are released only to address bugs in the product the t â€“ technology train , gets new features and bug fixes throughout its life , and is therefore potentially less stable than the mainline ( in releases prior to cisco ios release 12.0 , the p train served as the technology train ) cisco does n't recommend usage of t train in production environments unless there is urgency to implement a certain t train 's new ios feature the x ( xa , xb , etc these are eventually merged with one of the above trains , chap authentication ) passwords entered into the cli by default are weakly encrypted as 'type 7 ' ciphertext , such as '' router ( config ) username jdoe password 7 0832585b1910010713181f '' cisco filed a lawsuit , but settled after an injunction was issued to prevent further disclosures the ios xr development train used the real-time operating system microkernel ( qnx ) , so a large part of the ios source code was re-written to take advantage of the features offered by the kernel
