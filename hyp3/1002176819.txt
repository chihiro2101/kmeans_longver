the pelvic splanchnic nerves reside in the lateral gray horn of the spinal cord at the t12-l1 vertebral levels ( the spinal cord terminates at the l1-l2 vertebrae with the conus medullaris ) , and their axons exit the vertebral column as s2-s4 spinal nerves through the sacral foramina the parasympathetic ganglion where these preganglionic neurons synapse will be close to the organ of innervation the axons of presynaptic parasympathetic neurons are usually long , extending from the cns into a ganglion that is either very close to or embedded in their target organ from the ciliary ganglion the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave via short ciliary nerve fibers , a continuation of the nasociliary nerve ( a branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve ( cn v 1 ) ) the short ciliary nerves innervate the orbit to control the ciliary muscle ( responsible for accommodation ) and the iris sphincter muscle , which is responsible for miosis or constriction of the pupil ( in response to light or accommodation ) the parasympathetic aspect of the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands , the lacrimal gland , and the glands associated with the nasal cavity the lesser palatine nerve synapses at the soft palate and controls sparse taste receptors and mucus glands the vagus gives no parasympathetic to the cranium the vagus nerve is hard to track definitively due to its ubiquitous nature in the thorax and abdomen so the major contributions will be discussed as the main vagus nerves continue into the thorax they become intimately linked with the esophagus and sympathetic nerves from the sympathetic trunks to form the esophageal plexus unlike in the cranium , where one parasympathetic is in charge of one particular tissue or region , for the most part the pelvic splanchnics each contribute fibers to pelvic viscera by traveling to one or more plexuses before being dispersed to the target tissue unconsciously , the parasympathetic will cause peristaltic movements of the ureters and intestines , moving urine from the kidneys into the bladder and food down the intestinal tract and , upon necessity , the parasympathetic will assist in excreting urine from the bladder or defecation stimulation of the parasympathetic will cause the detrusor muscle ( urinary bladder wall ) to contract and simultaneously relax the internal sphincter muscle between the bladder and the urethra , allowing the bladder to void assuming that the reported findings most likely applies to other mammals as well , this perspective suggests a simplified , bipartite architecture of the autonomic nervous system , in which the parasympathetic nervous system receives input from cranial nerves exclusively and the sympathetic nervous system from thoracic to sacral spinal nerves while the unconscious reflex arcs normally are undetectable , in certain instances they may send pain sensations to the cns masked as referred pain the pain is also usually referred to dermatomes that are at the same spinal nerve level as the visceral afferent synapse as a result , the cells of the node spontaneously generate electrical activity that is subsequently conducted throughout the heart , resulting in a regular heart rate this modulation is mediated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and downstream changes to ionic currents and calcium of heart cells the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in heart rate regulation by modulating the response of sinoatrial node ; vagal tone can be quantified by investigating heart rate modulation induced by vagal tone changes another role that the parasympathetic nervous system plays is in sexual activity at the same time , parasympathetics cause peristalsis of the urethral muscle , and the pudendal nerve causes contraction of the bulbospongiosus ( skeletal muscle is not via pn ) , to forcibly emit the semen the secretions from the female genital tract aid in sperm migration the m4 muscarinic receptors : postganglionic cholinergic nerves , possible cns effects the m5 muscarinic receptors : possible effects on the cns types of nicotinic receptors in vertebrates , nicotinic receptors are broadly classified into two subtypes based on their primary sites of expression : muscle-type nicotinic receptors ( n1 ) primarily for somatic motor neurons ; and neuronal-type nicotinic receptors ( n2 ) primarily for autonomic nervous system the sympathetic division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses
