in 1890 , the first such patented press was built in liverpool , england by bibby , baron and sons by the 1920s , most presses were made in germany , where the process was called '' gummidruck '' , or rubber printing individual firms tried using new names for the process , such as '' lustro printing '' and '' transglo printing '' , but met with limited success in 1951 franklin moss , then the president of the mosstype corporation , conducted a poll among the readers of his journal the mosstyper to submit new names for the printing process since 1990 , great advances have been made to the quality of flexographic printing presses , printing plates , ink systems and printing inks companies like dupont , kodak and esko have pioneered the latest technologies , with advances in fast washout and the latest screening technology it is washed away in a tank of either water or solvent brushes scrub the plate to facilitate the '' washout '' process the unit is equipped with a dual membrane filter with this the environmental burdening is kept to an absolute minimum after addition of absorb gelatine for example , the photopolymer residue can be disposed of as standard solid waste together with household refuse such a direct laser engraving process is called digital platemaking later , magnesium was used these mounting marks can be microdots ( down to 0.3 & nbsp ; mm ) and/or crosses precision mounting is critical for producing good quality print which is in the register and has a direct impact on minimizing waste there are two key areas to achieve effective plate mounting , positioning the plate correctly and achieving a good bond accurate positioning is essential or the images of each colour will not be superimposed correctly , they will be out of register types of registration marks these are various types of mark used for aligning the plates correctly : registration crosses are commonly used but need to be positioned in waste areas as they are easily seen on the print , they can also be used as a guide for aligning the print to a bag or box structure if this is required since they are so small they do n't have to be in waste areas as they are not easily seen if they are incorrect , mounting can be difficult , time-consuming and inaccurate , so they need to be planned carefully the marks should be positioned symmetrically always have a pair positioned in the middle of the plate in line with the sleeve axis the same principle is applied for multiple plates across the sleeve and so either two cameras per plate are used or two cameras are used which move into the correct position driven by servo motors and camera setting software the plate is carefully positioned over tape , usually by hand so that the register marks are seen directly below the cameras then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll ( or meter roll ) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly ( the number of cells per linear inch can vary according to the type of print job and the quality required ) , hoboken , new jersey the sheet is then fed through a dryer , which allows the inks to dry before the surface is touched again in modern flexographic printing , the anilox roll is referred to as a type of meter or metering roller impression cylinder the impression cylinder applies pressure to the plate cylinder where the image is transferred to the image-receiving substrate the fountain roll or two-roll system has one roll spinning in an ink pan pressed against the anilox roll to transfer a layer of ink to then be applied to the printing plate this system is best used for low quality print such as flood coats and block lettering due to its inability to produce a clean wipe of the anilox roll the dual blade system is an enclosed system that has one doctor blade for doctoring the ink and one containment blade that contains the ink in the chamber and allows ink from the anilox roll back in this press prints on both sides , via a turnbar
