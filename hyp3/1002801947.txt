the geodesic structure is also redundant and so can survive localized damage without catastrophic failure a simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core , with a fiberglass covering , eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds , but requiring more effort in finishing ( see the rutan varieze ) the use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the boeing 787 dreamliner ( using pressure-molding on female molds ) most modern large aircraft are built using this technique , but use several large sections constructed in this fashion which are then joined with fasteners to form the complete fuselage as the accuracy of the final product is determined largely by the costly fixture , this form is suitable for series production , where many identical aircraft are to be produced early examples of this type include the douglas aircraft dc-2 and dc-3 civil aircraft and the boeing b-17 flying fortress from wings and empennage , and from discrete masses such as the engine ) is taken by the surface covering early aircraft were constructed of wood frames covered in fabric as monoplanes became popular , metal frames improved the strength , which eventually led to all-metal-structure aircraft , with metal covering for all its exterior surfaces - this was first junkers j 1 ) each on an airbus a320 a blended wing body can be considered a mixture of the above
