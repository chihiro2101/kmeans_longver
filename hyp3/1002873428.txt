none of the combatants considered the use of tear gas to be in conflict with the hague treaty of 1899 , which specifically prohibited the launching of projectiles containing asphyxiating or poisonous gas the first instance of large-scale use of gas as a weapon was on 31 january 1915 , when germany fired 18,000 artillery shells containing liquid xylyl bromide tear gas on russian positions on the rawka river , west of warsaw during the battle of bolimov this letter must be discounted as evidence for early german use of chlorine , however , because the date '' 2 january 1915 '' may have been hastily scribbled instead of the intended '' 2 january 1916 , '' the sort of common typographical error that is often made at the beginning of a new year at 17:30 , in a slight easterly breeze , the liquid chlorine was siphoned from the tanks , producing gas which formed a grey-green cloud that drifted across positions held by french colonial troops from martinique , as well as the 1st tirailleurs and the 2nd zouaves from algeria the german infantry were also wary of the gas and , lacking reinforcements , failed to exploit the break before the 1st canadian division and assorted french troops reformed the line in scattered , hastily prepared positions apart '' edmonds and wynne ( 1927 ) : p the russian army took 9,000 casualties , with more than 1,000 fatalities it quickly became evident that the men who stayed in their places suffered less than those who ran away , as any movement worsened the effects of the gas , and that those who stood up on the fire step suffered less—indeed they often escaped any serious effects—than those who lay down or sat at the bottom of a trench edmonds and wynne ( 1927 ) : pp chlorine was less effective as a weapon than the germans had hoped , particularly as soon as simple countermeasures were introduced it was thought to be even more effective to use urine rather than water , as it was known at the time that chlorine reacted with urea ( present in urine ) to form dichloro urea despite its limitations , chlorine was an effective psychological weapon—the sight of an oncoming cloud of the gas was a continual source of dread for the infantry the germans issued their troops with small gauze pads filled with cotton waste , and bottles of a bicarbonate solution with which to dampen the pads the british expressed outrage at germany 's use of poison gas at ypres and responded by developing their own gas warfare capability a positive correlation has been proven between exposure to mustard agents and skin cancers , other respiratory and skin conditions , leukemia , several eye conditions , bone marrow depression and subsequent immunosuppression , psychological disorders and sexual dysfunction mary fox , frank curriero , kathryn kulbicki , beth resnick , thomas burke , '' evaluating the community health legacy of wwi chemical weapons testing , '' journal of community health , 35 , ( 18 november 2009 ) : 96–97 some us veterans who were closely affected by chemical weapons showed no neurological evidence in the following years
