plant cryopreservation consist of the storage of seeds , pollen , tissue , or embryos in liquid nitrogen the storage of seeds in a temperature and moisture controlled environment seed bank facilities vary from sealed boxes to climate controlled walk-in freezers or vaults plants under horticulture care in a constructed landscape , typically a botanic garden or arboreta cryoconservation of animal genetic resources a potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy , implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species , carrying it to term it has been carried out for the spanish ibex this ensures that rarer alleles are passed on , which helps to increase genetic diversity it is also important to avoid mating two individuals with very different mean kinship values because such pairings propagate both the rare alleles that are present in the individual with the low mean kinship value as well as the common alleles that are present in the individual with the high mean kinship value genetic diversity is often lost within captive populations due to the founder effect and subsequent small population sizes minimizing the number of generations in captivity is another effective method for reducing the loss of genetic diversity in captive populations adaptations to captivity can be reduced by minimizing the number of generations in captivity and by maximizing the number of migrants from wild populations immigrants are then exchanged between the fragments to reduce inbreeding , and then the fragments are managed separately again showy indian clover , trifolium amoenum , is an example of a species that was thought to be extinct , but was rediscovered in 1993 connors , p the wollemi pine is another example of a plant that is being preserved via ex situ conservation , as they are being grown in nurseries to be sold to the general public ex situ conservation , while helpful in humankind 's efforts to sustain and protect our environment , is rarely enough to save a species from extinction it is to be used as a last resort , or as a supplement to in situ conservation because it can not recreate the habitat as a whole : the entire genetic variation of a species , its symbiosis counterparts , or those elements which , over time , might help a species adapt to its changing surroundings in the case of cryogenic storage methods , the preserved specimen 's adaptation processes are ( quite literally ) frozen altogether cloning to revive extinct species , may 28 , 2002 , grant holloway , cnn reproductive technologies and conservation of endangered cats louisiana 's frozen ark online book : '' in situ conservation of livestock and poultry '' , 1992 , food and agriculture organization of the united nations and the united nations environment programme '' the challenges of ex situ orchid conservation '' , orchid conservation coalition botanic gardens conservation international â€“ international organisation supporting ex-situ conservation of priority plant species domestic animal diversity information system implementing the global plan of action for animal genetic resources
