cyrix would later release the cyrix 486srx2 and 486drx2 , which were essentially clock-doubled versions of the slc and dlc , marketed exclusively to consumers as 386-to-486 upgrades while amd had been able to sell some of its 486s to large oems , notably acer and compaq , cyrix had not in 1995 , with its pentium clone not yet ready to ship , cyrix repeated its own history and released the cyrix cx5x86 ( m1sc ) , which plugged into a 3.3v 486 socket , ran at 80 , 100 , 120 , or 133 & nbsp ; mhz , and yielded performance comparable to that of a pentium running at 75 & nbsp ; mhz like intel 's pentium overdrive , the cyrix 5x86 used a 32-bit external data bus later in 1995 , cyrix released its best-known chip , the cyrix 6x86 ( m1 ) unlike previous 3d games , quake used the pipelined pentium fpu to do perspective correction calculations in the background while texture mapping , effectively doing two tasks at once this would not have been a big problem for the 6x86 if , by that time , quake had a fallback to do perspective correction without the fpu as in , for example , the game descent cyrix 6x86l and 6x86mx the cyrix mii , based on the 6x86mx design , was little more than a name change intended to help the chip compete better with the pentium ii cyrix developed the cayenne core as an evolution of the 6x86mx/mii processor , with dual issue fpu , support for 3dnow instructions and a 256 & nbsp ; kb , 8-way associative , on-die l2 cache this was a completely new core with a dual issue fpu , register renaming and out-of-order execution based on an 11-stage pipeline and 8-way associative , 8-way interleaved fully pipelined 256k l2 cache operating at core frequency jalepeno had an on-die memory controller based on rambus technology capable of 3.2gb/s to reduce memory latency and an integrated on-board 3d graphics which purportedly could process up to 3 & nbsp ; million polygons per second and 266 & nbsp ; million pixels per second based on a 233 & nbsp ; mhz clock while some in the industry speculated this would lead to ibm using 6x86 cpus extensively in its product line and improve cyrix 's reputation , ibm continued to mostly use intel cpus , and to a lesser extent , amd cpus , in the majority of its products and only used the cyrix designs in a few budget models , mostly sold outside of the united states thus , while amd 's 386s and even 486s had some intel-written microcode software , cyrix 's designs were completely independent intel lost the cyrix case , which included multiple lawsuits in both federal and state courts in texas some of the matters were settled out-of-court and some of the matters were settled by the court cyrix was found to never have infringed any patent held by intel intel and cyrix now had full and free access to each others ' patents merger with national semiconductor since the manufacture of ram and cpus are similar , industry analysts at the time believed the marriage made sense this was more stable , but adversely affected system performance meanwhile , the mediagx faced pressure from intel 's and amd 's budget chips , which also continued to get less expensive while offering greater performance by the time national semiconductor sold cyrix to via technologies , the design team was no more and the market for the mii had disappeared although the company was short-lived and the brand name is no longer actively used by its current owner , cyrix 's competition with intel created the market for budget cpus , which cut the average selling price of pcs and ultimately forced intel to release its celeron line of budget processors and cut the prices of its faster processors more quickly in order to compete the film eraser featured a defense corporation known as '' cyrex '' in the machinima series freeman 's mind , ross scott as gordon freeman ( of the half-life video game franchise ) curses cyrix processors as a computer breaks in episode 3 .
