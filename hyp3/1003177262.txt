alt url at some point this effect also gained the moniker '' biefeld–brown effect '' , probably coined by brown to claim denison university professor of physics and astronomy paul alfred biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter brown filed another patent in 1960 that detailed the physics of the biefeld–brown effect , making the following claims : there is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect , where the shorter the distance , the greater the effect there is a positive correlation between the dielectric strength of the material between the electrodes and the strength of the effect , where the higher the strength , the greater the effect however , there is little experimental evidence that serves to validate his claims this creates a high field gradient around the smaller , positively charged electrode whether this increases or decreases the maximum momentum of the ionized air is not typically measured , although the force acting upon the electrodes reduces , until the glow discharge region is entered air force researcher r around the same time in 2003 , researchers from the army research laboratory ( arl ) tested the biefeld–brown effect by building four different-sized asymmetric capacitors based on simple designs found on the internet and then applying a high voltage of around 30 kv to them having proposed that the biefeld–brown effect could theoretically be explained using ion drift instead of ion wind due to how the former involves collisions instead of ballistic trajectories , they noted these were only '' scaling estimates '' and more experimental and theoretical work was needed bahder 2003 , pp in 2004 , martin tajmar published a paper that also failed to replicate brown 's work and suggested that brown may have instead observed the effects of a corona wind triggered by insufficient outgassing of the electrode assembly in the vacuum chamber and therefore misinterpreted the corona wind effects as a possible connection between gravitation and electromagnetism , journal of space mixing , april 2004 , vol & nbsp ; 1–22 , valone , thomas , phd , pe
