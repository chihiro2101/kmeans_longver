signals ( perhaps from audio or video sensors ) are constantly converted from analog to digital , manipulated digitally , and then converted back to analog form such performance improvements have led to the introduction of digital signal processing in commercial communications satellites where hundreds or even thousands of analog filters , switches , frequency converters and so on are required to receive and process the uplinked signals and ready them for downlinking , and can be replaced with specialised dsps with significant benefits to the satellites ' weight , power consumption , complexity/cost of construction , reliability and flexibility of operation for example , the ses-12 and ses-14 satellites from operator ses launched in 2018 , were both built by airbus defence and space with 25 % of capacity using dsp most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller , since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system multiply–accumulates ( macs , including fused multiply–add , fma ) operations used extensively in all kinds of matrix operations convolution for filtering dot product horner scheme fundamental dsp algorithms depend heavily on multiply–accumulate performance fir filters fast fourier transform ( fft ) related isa and instructions : simd vliw superscalar architecture specialized instructions for modulo addressing in ring buffers and bit-reversed addressing mode for fft cross-referencing dsps sometimes use time-stationary encoding to simplify hardware and increase coding efficiency sometimes various sticky bits operation modes are available hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ( electronic computer ) hardware from the software that runs on it hardware modulo addressing allows circular buffers to be implemented without having to test for wrapping bit-reversed addressing , a special addressing mode useful for calculating ffts exclusion of a memory management unit address generation unit atal and manfred r in 1978 , american microsystems ( ami ) released the s2811 '' digital graphic audio equalizer '' the s2281 was the first integrated circuit chip specifically designed as a dsp , and fabricated using vmos ( v-groove mos ) , a technology that had previously not been mass-produced the s2811 was not successful in the market it had an on-chip adc/dac with an internal signal processor , but it did n't have a hardware multiplier and was not successful in the market the main improvement in the third generation was the appearance of application-specific units and instructions in the data path , or sometimes as coprocessors these units allowed direct hardware acceleration of very specific but complex mathematical problems , like the fourier-transform or matrix operations other dsps from 1995 are the ti tms320c541 or the tms 320c80 texas instruments produces the c6000 series dsps , which have clock speeds of 1.2 & nbsp ; ghz and implement separate instruction and data caches produces and licenses three distinct families of dsps perhaps the best known and most widely deployed is the ceva-teaklite dsp family , a classic memory-based architecture , with 16-bit or 32-bit word-widths and single or dual macs the blackfin family of embedded digital signal processors combine the features of a dsp with those of a general use processor the trimedia media processors support both fixed-point arithmetic as well as floating-point arithmetic , and have specific instructions to deal with complex filters and entropy coding most dsps use fixed-point arithmetic , because in real world signal processing the additional range provided by floating point is not needed , and there is a large speed benefit and cost benefit due to reduced hardware complexity embedded general-purpose risc processors are becoming increasingly dsp like in functionality in may 2018 , huarui-2 designed by nanjing research institute of electronics technology of china electronics technology group passed acceptance the design team has begun to create huarui-3 , which has a processing speed in tflops level and a support for artificial intelligence
