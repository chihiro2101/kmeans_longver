newton 's method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by euler in 1744 , whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by lambert in 1761–1777 modern orbit determination and prediction are used for operating all types of satellites and space probes , as it is necessary to know their future positions to a high degree of accuracy astrodynamics was developed by astronomer samuel herrick beginning in the 1930s the following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the rules without applying force ( such as firing a rocket engine ) , the period and shape of the satellite 's orbit wo n't change kepler 's laws of planetary motion , which can be mathematically derived from newton 's laws , hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces ; they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories in the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important of course in the case of rocket bursts there is no full reversal of events , both ways the same delta-v is used and the same mass ratio applies the increased accuracy often does not make enough of a difference in the calculation to be worthwhile a line joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time the squares of the orbital periods of planets are directly proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axis of the orbits the universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique , except now , instead of the six keplerian orbital elements , we use a different set of orbital elements : namely , the satellite 's initial position and velocity vectors x_0 and v_0 at a given epoch t 0 most of them can be handled on short timescales ( perhaps less than a few thousand orbits ) by perturbation theory because they are small relative to the corresponding two-body effects for spacecraft far from earth—for example those in orbits around the sun—an orbital maneuver is called a deep-space maneuver ( dsm ) however , a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse , by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change gravity assist and the oberth effect for example , it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to mars , passing close to one of the earth 's trojan points the biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow , taking many years they have , however , been employed on projects such as genesis aerodynamics aerospace engineering astrophysics canonical units celestial mechanics chaos theory kepler orbit lagrangian point mechanical engineering n-body problem orbit orders of magnitude ( speed ) roche limit spacecraft propulsion tsiolkovsky rocket equation universal variable formulation
