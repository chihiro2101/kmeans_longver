million in order to fund construction however , the full loan was initially withheld due to a case regarding un employee valentin gubitchev and a kgb spy judith coplon , who had been charged with espionage and were set to go on trial in march 1949 the house was loath to distribute the full 65 & nbsp ; million because the government was concerned that the un 's proposed headquarters would grant diplomatic immunity to the two individuals the headquarters were originally supposed to be completed in 1951 , with the first occupants moving into the secretariat building in 1950 two days after this announcement , workers erected the first steel beam for the secretariat building , to little official fanfare seven months later , on october 11 , truman accepted an invitation to attend a cornerstone-laying ceremony , which was planned to occur on october 24 at the ceremony , new york governor thomas e to fit in with the accelerated schedule of construction , the steel would have to be delivered by september the tunnel started construction on august 1 , 1949 the cost of construction was reported to be on budget at 65 & nbsp ;

billion renovation starting in the fall the renovations , which were the first since the complex opened in 1950 , were expected to take about 7 years to complete once again , these plans met resistance both within the un and from the united states and new york governments and were abandoned delegates speaking in any of these languages will have their words simultaneously interpreted into all of the others , and attendees are provided with headphones through which they can hear the interpretations '' official language '' united nations website english and french are the working languages of the united nations secretariat , as most of the daily communication within the secretariat and most of the signs in the un headquarters building are in those languages in 2005 , secretary-general kofi annan waived the immunity of benon sevan , aleksandr yakovlev , and vladimir kuznetsov in relation to the oil-for-food programme , and all were charged in the united states district court for the southern district of new york they are equipped with weapons and handcuffs and are sometimes mistaken for nypd officers due to the agencies ' similar uniforms journalists reporting from the complex often use '' united nations '' rather than '' new york city '' as the identification of their location in recognition of the extraterritoriality status however , only contacts made with the un headquarters in new york , and the itu count as separate entities the complex includes a number of major buildings while the secretariat building is most predominantly featured in depictions of the headquarters , it also includes the domed general assembly building , the dag hammarskjöld library , as well as the conference and visitors center , which is situated between the general assembly and secretariat buildings , and can be seen only from the fdr drive or the east river flanking the rostrum is a paneled semi-circular wall that tapers as it nears the ceiling and surrounds the front portion of the chamber the entrance to the hall bears an inscription from the gulistan by iranian poet saadi though fifty-four seals were eventually completed , these plans were scrapped in 1955 because secretary-general dag hammarskjöld felt they would distract from the purpose of the room each of the 192 delegations has six seats in the hall with three at a desk and three alternate seats behind them it was originally called the united nations library , later the united nations international library the library holds 400,000 books , 9,800 newspapers and periodical titles , 80,000 maps , and the woodrow wilson collection containing 8,600 volumes of league of nations documents and 6,500 related books and pamphlets the office of internal oversight services ( oios ) is located at 380 madison avenue in october 2011 city and state officials announced an agreement in which the un would be allowed to build a long-sought new office tower just south of the existing campus on the current robert moses playground , which would be relocated while host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan , it needs the approval of the united nations in order to be implemented the complex is notable for its gardens and outdoor sculptures iconic sculptures include the '' knotted gun '' , called non-violence , a statue of a colt python revolver with its barrel tied in a knot , which was a gift from the luxembourg government and united nations art collection , a gift from the soviet union rather , it is carved on the '' isaiah wall '' of ralph bunche park across first avenue the works are meant to merely be decorative with no symbolism two large murals by brazilian artist cândido portinari , entitled guerra e paz ( war and peace ) are located at the delegates hall some gatherings have taken place in ralph bunche park , but it is too small to accommodate large demonstrations the closest location where the new york city police department usually allows demonstrators is dag hammarskjöld plaza at 47th street and first avenue , one block away from the visitors ' entrance , four blocks away from the entrance used by top-level diplomats , and five blocks away from the general staff entrance excluding gatherings solely for diplomats and academics , there are a few organizations that regularly hold events at the un the united nations association of the united states of america ( una-usa ) , a non-governmental organization , holds an annual '' member 's day '' event in one of the conference rooms the only two films actually shot on location in the un headquarters are the glass wall ( 1953 ) by legendary hollywood writer/director/producer ivan tors and the interpreter ( 2005 ) by director sydney pollack
