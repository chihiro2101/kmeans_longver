a major task taken on by dennett in elbow room is to clearly describe just what people are as biology entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger wasp sphex for an animal like a wasp , this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely , the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on this is the type of mindless , pre-determined behavior that humans can avoid both determinism and indeterminism seem to rule out free will how do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be mechanics components of a mechanical universe ? what about determinism ? when we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice ? do people just ( through the action of their more complex brains ) simply have better behaviors than wasps , while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors ? dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one : all physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events indeterminism is not a solution to the free will problem we have free will dennett has slowly , through the course of the book , stripped the idea of behavioral choice from his idea of free will again , an argument from utility we should be satisfied with what we have and not fret over our lack of libertarian free will some say that dennett 's theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice but one does n't have to be free to achieve that goal people who lose the feeling that they can plan alternative behaviors and execute their choice of possible behaviors tend to become fatalistic and stop struggling for survival however , the same effect is attainted if , despite not believing in the control free will gives , we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency
