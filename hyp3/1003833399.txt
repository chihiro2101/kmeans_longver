beryllium copper is a ductile , weldable , and machinable alloy it has good thermal conductivity ( 62 btu/ft-deg.f-h ) 3-5 times more than tool steel c17200 copper has the strength and hardness similar to that of steel and rockwell hardness properties in its peaked age condition are in the range of 200 ksi and rc45 however , inhalation of dust , mist , or fume containing beryllium can cause the serious lung condition , berylliosis the national toxicology program ( ntp ) also lists beryllium as a carcinogen beryllium copper is non-sparking but physically tough and nonmagnetic , fulfilling the requirements of atex directive for zones 0 , 1 , and 2 an alternative metal sometimes used for non-sparking tools is aluminium bronze though some golfers prefer the feel of becu club heads , regulatory issues and high costs have made becu clubs difficult to find in current production becu dissipates heat from the valve as much as seven times faster than powdered steel or iron seats & guides no further heat treatment is necessary beyond a possible light stress relief high strength beryllium copper alloys contain as much as 2.7 % beryllium ( cast ) , or 1.6-2 % beryllium with about 0.3 % cobalt ( wrought ) the strength is achieved by age hardening
