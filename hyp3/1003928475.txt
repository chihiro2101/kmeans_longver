this creates an active leaven , which should grow in size and is ready to use when it is bubbly and floats in water this process is known as 'retardation ' to slow down the proofing process this may be convenient for single loaf production , but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread can not be achieved in a bread making machine , as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam biology and chemistry of sourdough the lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast can not , while the yeast metabolizes the by-products of lactic acid fermentation major lactic acid bacteria in sourdough are heterofermentative organisms and convert hexoses by the phosphoketolase pathway to lactate , co 2 and acetate or ethanol ; heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria are usually associated with homofermentative lactobacilli , particularly lactobacillus and companilactobacillus species f sanfranciscensis and limosilactobacillus pontis often highlight a lactic-acid bacterial flora that includes limosilactobacillus fermentum , fructilactobacillus fructivorans , levilactobacillus brevis , and companilactobacillus paralimentarius the yeasts saccharomyces exiguus , kasachstania humilis , or candida holmii usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with lactobacillus sanfranciscensis sanfrancisensis needs maltose and fructose '' yeasts have the ability to free fructose from glucofructans which compose about 1–2 % of the dough sanfrancisensis reduces all available fructose , it stops producing acetic acid and begins producing ethanol by days 5–7 , '' well-adapted '' lactobacillus strains such as l sanfranciscensis has typically not been identified in spontaneous sourdoughs , even after multiple cycles of back-slopping ; it was rapidly introduced in wheat sourdoughs , however , when plant materials were used to start the fermentation they have a ph less than 3.5 , and are fermented within a temperature range of for several days without feedings , which reduces the flora 's activity plantarum , and l it is also leavened with baking powder and baking soda in ethiopia , teff flour is fermented to make injera list of microorganisms found in sourdough salt-rising bread żurek , polish soup made with rye flour soured in the same process that occurs in the forming of sourdough injera
