festinger was born in brooklyn new york on may 8 , 1919 to russian-jewish immigrants alex festinger and sara solomon festinger '' schachter , 1994 , p american , 1959 , p 784 by his own admission , he was not interested in social psychology when he arrived at iowa , and did not take a single course in social psychology during his entire time there ; instead , he was interested in lewin 's earlier work on tension systems , but lewin 's focus had shifted to social psychology by the time festinger arrived at iowa 237 however , festinger continued to pursue his original interests , studying level of aspiration , festinger , 1942 working on statistics , festinger , 1943a festinger , 1943b developing a quantitative model of decision making , carlsmith & festinger , 1943 and even publishing a laboratory study on rats '' festinger , 1980 , p 237 festinger considered himself to be a freethinker and an atheist schachter & gazzaniga , 1989 , p 545 festinger and ballou were later divorced , and festinger married trudy bradley , currently a professor of social work at new york university , faculty profile , n.d '' festinger , 1980 , pp during this time , festinger published his highly influential paper on social comparison theory , extending his prior theory regarding the evaluation of attitudes in social groups to the evaluation of abilities in social groups he described the goal of his new research interests as “ seeing what can be inferred from different vantage points , from different data realms , about the nature , the characteristics , of this species we call human , ” festinger , 1980 , p for example , in a two-storey apartment building , people living on the lower floor next to a stairway are functionally closer to upper-floor residents than are others living on the same lower floor , brief meetings made as a result of going to and from home within the student housing community ) and that such passive contacts are more likely to occur given closer physical and functional distance between people festinger , 1950 festinger argued that people depend on social reality to determine the subjective validity of their attitudes and opinions , and that they look to their reference group to establish social reality ; an opinion or attitude is therefore valid to the extent that it is similar to that of the reference group he further argued that pressures to communicate arise when discrepancies in opinions or attitudes exist among members of a group , and laid out a series hypotheses regarding determinants of when group members communicate , whom they communicate with , and how recipients of communication react , citing existing experimental evidence to support his arguments people will , moreover , take action to reduce discrepancies in attitudes , whether by changing others to bring them closer to oneself or by changing one 's own attitudes to bring them closer to others thus festinger suggested that the '' social influence processes and some kinds of competitive behavior are both manifestations of the same socio-psychological process.namely , the drive for self evaluation and the necessity for such evaluation being based on comparison with other persons to the extent that objective , nonsocial means are available , people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison respectively with the opinions and abilities of others when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group , the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than those who are distant from the mode festinger and his collaborators , henry riecken and stanley schachter , examined conditions under which disconfirmation of beliefs leads to increased conviction in such beliefs in the 1956 book when prophecy fails many of the group members quit their jobs and disposed of their possessions in preparation for the apocalypse 169 that the group members had spread to use festinger 's example of a smoker who has knowledge that smoking is bad for his health , the smoker may reduce dissonance by choosing to quit smoking , by changing his thoughts about the effects of smoking ( e.g those paid 1 were forced to reduce dissonance by changing their opinions of the task to produce consonance with their behavior of reporting that the task was enjoyable '' aronson , 1991 , p 215 cognitive dissonance has been variously described as '' social psychology 's most notable achievement , '' zukier , 1989 , p 11 in addition , festinger is credited with the ascendancy of laboratory experimentation in social psychology as one who '' converted the experiment into a powerful scientific instrument with a central role in the search for knowledge zajonc , 1990 , p warning against the dangers of such demands when theoretical concepts are not yet fully developed , festinger stated , '' research can increasingly address itself to minor unclarities in prior research rather than to larger issues ;
