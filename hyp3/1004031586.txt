one of alexander 's hobbies was mechanics and he employed nearly all his spare time in his workshop where he encouraged his youngest son to work with him in all sorts of materials nasmyth therefore decided instead to show maudslay examples of his skills and produced a complete working model of a high-pressure steam engine , creating the working drawings and constructing the components himself he moved to patricroft , an area of the town of eccles , lancashire , where in august 1836 , he and his business partner holbrook gaskell opened the bridgewater foundry , where they traded as nasmyth , gaskell and company in march 1838 james was making a journey by coach from sheffield to york in a snowstorm , when he spied some ironwork furnaces in the distance the coachman informed him that they were managed by a mr hartop at his house , and was invited to stay the night and visit the works the next day '' he then communicated the same to her parents , and told them his prospects , and so became betrothed in the same day in 1837 , the great western steam company was experiencing many problems forging the paddle shaft of the ss great britain ; when even the largest hammer was tilted to its full height its range was so small that if a really large piece of work were placed on the anvil , the hammer had no room to fall , and in 1838 the company 's engineer wrote to nasmyth : '' i find there is not a forge-hammer in england or scotland powerful enough to forge the paddle-shaft of the engine for the great britain ! what am i to do ? ‚Äù ( francis humphries , 1838 ) nasmyth thought the matter over and seeing the obvious defects of the trip hammer ( it delivered every blow with the same force ) sketched out his idea for the first steam hammer it weighed and lifted to the first hammers were of the free-fall type but they were later modified , given power-assisted fall he drove a pile 70 feet long and 18 & nbsp ; inches squared in four and a half minutes , while the conventional method required twelve hours among nasmyth 's other inventions , most of which he never patented , were a means of transmitting rotary motion by means of a flexible shaft made of coiled wire , a machine for cutting key grooves , self-adjusting bearings , and the screw ladle for moving molten metal which could safely and efficiently be handled by two men instead of the six previously required a reluctant patentor , and in this instance still working through some problems in his method , nasmyth abandoned the project after hearing of bessemer 's ideas in 1856 a crater on the moon is named after him he was happily married to his wife anne , from woodburn , yorkshire , for 50 years , until his death they had no children the monument holds a well-carved model of his steam hammer benjamin hick john hick
