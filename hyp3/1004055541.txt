the game 's main setting is an immense , futuristic city called alpha complex the computer serves as the game 's principal antagonist , and fears a number of threats to its 'perfect ' society , such as the outdoors , mutants , and secret society ( especially communism ) , almost certainly dangerous and faulty ) thus , missions often turn into a comedy of errors , as everyone on the team seeks to double-cross everyone else while keeping their own secrets six editions have been published three of these were published by west end games - the 1st , 2nd , and '' fifth '' editions - whereas the later three editions ( paranoia xp , the 25th anniversary edition and the '' red clearance '' edition ) were published by mongoose publishing this edition , while encouraging dark humour in-game , took a fairly serious dystopian tone ; the supplements and adventures released to accompany it emphasised the lighter side , however , establishing the freewheeling mix of slapstick , intra-team backstabbing and satire that is classically associated with a game of paranoia 150px 2nd edition - written by greg costikyan , dan gelber , eric goldberg , ken rolston , and paul murphy - published in 1987 by west end games in particular , many felt the removal of the computer - and thus the power structure associated with it - and the greater freedom given to player characters effectively wrecked the very premise of the game , which required that player characters had little freedom , had to appease the demands of the computer , and were presented with insane situations that arose from the ludicrous rules of alpha complex society in ken ’ s wake , developers doug kaufman and paul murphy in turn briefly supervised the paranoia line following the extremely negative reception of the fifth edition , west end games began planning a new edition of the game , which would be released as the '' third edition '' the designers in turn granted a license to mongoose publishing to produce a new version of the game , with the result that paranoia xp , written by allen varney , aaron allston , paul baldowski , beth fischi , dan curtis johnson and greg costikyan , was published in 2004 as such , the name was shortened to just paranoia best for a one-shot game of paranoia the symbol of this game style is an enormous eye , much like the eye on the front cover very good for an ongoing campaign in a posting on rpg.net he explained that the point of including the three playstyles in paranoia xp was to counteract the impression that '' zap '' -styled play was the default for paranoia , an impression which had in part been created by the more cartoonish later supplements in the west end games line ( as well as '' fifth edition '' ) paranoia xp marked his return to the line as well ; he has designed every cover of the xp edition , and many books contain both his classic and new paranoia art new threats to alpha complex include file sharing , phishing scams , identity theft and wmds in june 2009 , mongoose publishing announced that they would be retiring the books in the xp line to clear the way for the 25th anniversary edition line - revealing a new edition of the rulebook as well as two new rulebooks , one casting the players as higher-clearance internal security investigators and one as ultraviolet high programmers each of the three books is an entirely self-contained and playable game : paranoia : troubleshooters , paranoia : internal security , and paranoia : high programmers allen varney , designer of the xp edition , explained in a posting on rpg.net that this decision came about as a result of the xp edition successfully convincing the wider gaming public that '' zap '' was not the default playstyle for the game ; since it was now generally accepted that paranoia could have a variety of playstyles and each gm would interpret it somewhat differently , it was considered no longer necessary to emphasise the different playstyles in the main text the most recent edition ( at the time of writing ) from mongoose publishing was announced through kickstarter october 24 , 2014 but if you like high-tension suspense along with a slightly bent sense of humor , paranoia is a unique and highly desirable experience dedicated rule lawyers and wargamers will hate it still , a close inspection of the combat system revealed that it was slow moving and cumbersome this game is best treated as a succession of short adventure sessions in which players get to enjoy themselves doing all those despicable things that would spoil a more 'serious ’ game it introduced something scarier paranoia won the origins award for best roleplaying rules of 1984 the game was inducted into the origins awards hall of fame in 2007 it was available for amiga , amstrad cpc , commodore 64 and zx spectrum a paranoia-themed piece of '' choose-your-own-adventure '' hyperfiction ( or gamebook ) was published in issue 77 of the space gamer magazine in the late '80s since then , various unauthorised automated versions of the story ( a troubleshooter 's assignment to undermine the subversive activity known as christmas ) have been circulating through mainframes and pcs , with machine-independent ports to c , python , go and inform as well as to adventure game toolkit and for applix , cp/m and the cybiko it is an isometric view real-time with pause rpg mongoose publishing 's paranoia homepage
