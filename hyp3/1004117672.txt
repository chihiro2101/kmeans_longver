weir converted the dripstick reading from centimetres to litres to kilograms , finding that it agreed with the fqis during the handover , weir told pearson that there was a problem with the fqis , and pearson decided to take on enough fuel to fly to edmonton without refueling in ottawa while waiting for the fuel truck , he enabled the defective channel and performed an fqis self-test the airplane flew to ottawa without incident , where another dripstick measurement was taken and converted using the density in pounds/litre a few seconds later , the fuel pressure alarm also sounded for the right engine this prompted the pilots to divert to winnipeg within seconds , the left engine failed and the pilots began preparing for a single-engine landing since the engines supply power for the hydraulic systems , the aircraft was designed with a ram air turbine , a backup generator that swings out from a compartment and converts the air flowing past the airplane into rotational movement as the gimli pilots performed a partial side-slip manoeuvre ( forward slip ) to reduce altitude prior to landing , the disrupted airflow past the ram air turbine also meant a decrease in the hydraulic power available , and they were surprised to find the aircraft slow to respond when straightening after the forward-slip in the aircraft lost , giving a glide ratio of approximately 12:1 ( dedicated glider planes reach ratios of 50:1 to 70:1 ) gimli motorsports park website it included a road race course , a go-kart track , and a dragstrip a canadian automobile sport clubs-sanctioned sports car race hosted by the winnipeg sports car club was underway at the time of the incident and the area around the decommissioned runway was full of cars and campers as the plane drew near the runway , it became apparent that the aircraft was coming in too high and fast , raising the danger of the 767 running off the runway before it could be stopped as the aircraft 's nose had collapsed onto the ground , its tail was elevated and there were some minor injuries when passengers exited the aircraft via the rear slides , which were not long enough to sufficiently accommodate the increased height the safety board also said that air canada needed to keep more spare parts , including replacements for the defective fuel quantity indicator , in its maintenance inventory as well as provide better , more thorough training on the metric system to its pilots and fuelling personnel the final report of the investigation was published in april 1985 the amount of fuel in the tanks of a boeing 767 is computed by the fuel quantity indication system ( fqis ) and displayed in the cockpit an engineer in edmonton duly did so when the aircraft arrived from toronto following a trouble-free flight the day before the incident while conducting this check , the fqis failed and the cockpit fuel gauges went blank this reports that the fuel gauges were blank and that the second fqis channel was disabled , but does not make clear that the latter fixed the former the outgoing pilot informed captain pearson and first officer quintal of the problem with the fqis and passed along his mistaken belief that the aircraft had flown the previous day with this problem c-gaun was the 47th boeing 767 off the production line , and had been delivered to air canada less than four months previously because of this unreliability , it had become practice for flights to be authorized by maintenance personnel one technician stopped after he found that he was n't making any progress pearson and quintal both used the density of jet fuel in lb/l without converting to kg/l : :7,682 litres × 1.77 lb/l 13,597 lb misinterpreted as kilograms of fuel already on board :22,300 kg − 13,597 kg 8,703 kg incorrect mass of additional fuel required :8,703 kg ÷ ( 1.77 lb/l ) 4,917 l·kg/lb misinterpreted as litres of additional fuel required instead of taking on the 20,088 litres of additional fuel that they required , they took on only 4,917 litres this was approximately half of the amount required to reach their destination he testified that it was a '' regular practice of his '' to do such calculations in 1985 the pilots were awarded the first ever fédération aéronautique internationale diploma for outstanding airmanship following a successful appeal against their suspensions , pearson and quintal were assigned as crew members aboard another air canada flight the discovery channel canada / national geographic tv series mayday covered the incident in a 2008 episode titled '' gimli glider '' flight ac7067 was captained by jean-marc bélanger , a former head of the air canada pilots association , while captains robert pearson and maurice quintal were on board to oversee the flight from montreal to california 's mojave airport in june 2017 , a permanent museum exhibit of the event opened in gimli , 1992 , freefall : from 41,000 feet to zero – a true story , william and marilyn hoffer , simon &
