māori settled the islands and developed a distinct culture over several hundred years māori mythology is a distinctive corpus of gods and heroes , sharing some polynesian motifs the distinct values , history , and worldview of māori are expressed through traditional arts and skills such as haka , tā moko , waiata , carving , weaving , and poi new zealand became partly self-governing in 1852 with the establishment of its own parliament pākehā culture ( usually synonymous with new zealand european culture ) derives mainly from that of the british , particularly english settlers who colonised new zealand in the nineteenth century part of the problem is that high culture is often mistaken for culture in general , and the lack of recognition historically given to new zealand 's artists , writers and composers is seen as evidence of a lack of culture from the 1980s pākehā began to further explore their distinctive traditions and to argue that new zealanders had a culture which was neither māori nor british there was an interest in '' kiwiana '' —items from new zealand 's heritage that are seen as representing iconic kiwi elements , such as the pohutakawa ( new zealand christmas tree ) , pāua-shell ash-tray , buzzy bee , pineapple lumps , gumboots and jandals , in canterbury ) , irish settlers ( e.g , on the south island west coast ) , and scottish settlers ( e.g , in otago and southland ) various aspects of each culture have added to new zealand culture ; chinese new year is celebrated for example , especially in auckland and dunedin , and south auckland has strong samoan cultural links the popular music style of urban pasifika also has its origins in the new zealand pacific island community , and has become a major strand in new zealand music culture pacific island heritage is also celebrated in much of new zealand 's fine art , with notable artists such as fatu feu ' u , lily laita , john pule , yuki kihara , and michel tuffery all heavily influenced by their pacific origins cultural borrowing and adaptation māori borrowing from pākehā culture after the defeat of rebel māori who attempted to establish a renegade state in the king country , the adoption of pākehā culture became less of a free choice as pākehā began to outnumber māori harmsworth , garth ( november 2002 ) since the late nineteenth century , pākehā have used māori cultural practices when they required something distinctive the tourist industry has also made heavy use of māori culture in an effort to present tourists with distinctly new zealand experiences and items one example of this is the '' haka party attack '' of 1979 university of auckland engineering students had a tradition of performing a mock haka at graduation most popular new zealand music derives from anglo-american styles , particularly rock music , hip-hop , electronic dance music and related subgenres in general , the development of international mass media and mass communication has meant new zealanders have always been aware of developments in other countries ; this lends itself to the adoption of new forms and styles from overseas the māori language and new zealand sign language also have official status , in certain contexts , as defined by their respective statutes an eastern polynesian language , te reo māori , is closely related to tahitian and cook islands māori ; slightly less closely to hawaiian and marquesan ; and more distantly to the languages of western polynesia , including samoan , niuean and tongan it uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than bsl , reflecting new zealand 's history of oralist education of deaf people new zealand sign language became an official language of new zealand in april 2006 according to the 2013 census , 174 languages are used in new zealand ( including sign languages ) from the early twentieth century āpirana ngata and others began a programme of reviving traditional māori arts , and many new meeting houses were built with traditional carving and tukutuku woven wall panels were built a number of māori artists , including paratene matchitt and shane cotton have combined western modernism with traditional māori art new zealand drama , both on stage and screen , has been plagued during much of its history by cost and lack of popular interest in new zealand culture the most well-known include douglas lilburn , john psathas , jack body , gillian whitehead , jenny mcleod , gareth farr , ross harris , and martin lodge new zealand 's most successful early writers were expatriates such as katherine mansfield until about the 1980s , the main new zealand literary form was the short story , but in recent decades novels such as alan duff 's once were warriors , elizabeth knox 's the vintner 's luck and others have achieved critical and popular success barry crump was a popular author who embodied and expounded the myth of the kiwi larrikin and multi-skilled labourer the sports that most new zealanders participate in are rugby union , cricket , basketball , netball , association football ( the most popular sport amongst children ) , rugby league and hockey the style of name has been followed in naming the national team in several other sports horseracing was also a popular spectator sport and became part of the '' rugby , racing and beer '' culture during the 1960s some have argued that rugby is a national religion pre-colonial māori religion was animistic many māori members of mainstream churches , and those with no particular religion , continue to believe in tapu , particularly where the dead are concerned , although not to the same extent as their ancestors the vast majority of religious pākehā are christian , but a small number follow non-christian religions , particularly buddhism the scottish ( presbyterian ) english ( anglican ) division can still be seen in the religious distribution of some cities and suburbs it has also been evidenced that new zealand 's lack of religion correlates with income and income correlates with urban location ; in auckland , for example , the richest suburbs are the least religious until about the 1980s it was often claimed that new zealand was a 'classless society' sinclair , keith ( 1969 ) , a history of new zealand , 2nd edn , p.285 new zealand 's claims to be a classless society were dealt a fatal blow in the 1980s and 1990s by the economic reforms of the fourth labour government and its successor , the fourth national government tim hazledine ( 1998 ) taking new zealand seriously : the economics of decency recent appreciation of real estate values increased the wealth of a generation of landowners while making housing unaffordable for many since the signing of the trans-tasman travel arrangement in 1973 , new zealanders have had the right to live and work in australia on equal terms with australian citizens such agreements are in place with : argentina , belgium , brazil , canada , chile , czech republic , denmark , finland , france , germany , hong kong , republic of ireland , italy , japan , south korea , malaysia , malta , mexico , netherlands , norway , singapore , spain , sweden , taiwan , thailand , the united kingdom and uruguay nz ministry of foreign affairs and trade website : the stereotypical new zealand male is essentially a pioneer type : he is perceived to be rural , strong , unemotional , democratic , has little time for high culture , good with animals ( particularly horses ) and machines , and is able to turn his hand to nearly anything new zealand men are supposed to still have many of these qualities , even though most new zealanders have lived in urban areas since the late nineteenth century social conservatism and progressiveness new zealanders , both those of pākehā and māori roots , have been described as an individualistic people , who take intrusion very personally , especially when it occurs onto private land ( but also sometimes in a wider sense ) in everyday life the two foods of māori origin are '' the boil up '' ( boiled up left over food meat and vegetable scraps sometimes thickened with flour ) , and the hāngi which is associated with special occasions meat pies , sausage rolls , and fish and chips are popular pākehā are fond of sweet foods such as biscuits , dessert bars and pavlova , in terry sturm , ed , social class in new zealand
