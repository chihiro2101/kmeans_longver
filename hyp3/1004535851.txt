similarly , has a spin of 1/2 and must gamma-decay to with a spin of 9/2 during internal conversion , energy of nuclear de-excitation is not emitted as a gamma ray , but is instead used to accelerate one of the inner electrons of the atom metastable isomers can be produced through nuclear fusion or other nuclear reactions this designation is placed after the mass number of the atom ; for example , cobalt-58m1 is abbreviated , where 27 is the atomic number of cobalt increasing indices , m1 , m2 , etc this geometry can result in quantum-mechanical states where the distribution of protons and neutrons is so much further from spherical geometry that de-excitation to the nuclear ground state is strongly hindered in general , these states either de-excite to the ground state far more slowly than a '' usual '' excited state , or they undergo spontaneous fission with half-life of the order of nanoseconds or microseconds—a very short time , but many orders of magnitude longer than the half-life of a more usual nuclear excited state quantum mechanics predicts that certain atomic species should possess isomers with unusually long lifetimes even by this stricter standard and have interesting properties its half-life is at least 10 15 years , markedly longer than the age of the universe the low excitation energy of the isomeric state causes both gamma de-excitation to the ground state ( which itself is radioactive by beta decay , with a half-life of only 8 hours ) and direct beta decay to hafnium or tungsten to be suppressed due to spin mismatches it possesses a half-life of 31 years and the highest excitation energy of any comparably long-lived isomer these reports indicate that the energy is released very quickly , so that can produce extremely high powers ( on the order of exawatts ) has a remarkably low-lying metastable isomer , estimated at only 8.28 & nbsp ; ± & nbsp ; 0.17 & nbsp ; ev above the ground state leon van dommelen , quantum mechanics for engineers ( chapter 14 ) this claim is generally discounted the potential to trigger an abrupt release of energy from nuclear isotopes , a prerequisite to their use in such weapons , is disputed an isotope such as 177 lu releases gamma rays by decay through a series of internal energy levels within the nucleus , and it is thought that by learning the triggering cross sections with sufficient accuracy , it may be possible to create energy stores that are 10 6 times more concentrated than high explosive or other traditional chemical energy storage the emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state allows the nucleus to lose energy and reach a lower-energy state , sometimes its ground state reprints of articles about nuclear isomers in peer reviewed journals – the center for quantum electronics , the university of texas at dallas .
