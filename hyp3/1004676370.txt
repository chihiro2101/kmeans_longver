the front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear , although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch ( iso 559 ) , iso 571 ( 650c ) , iso 622 ( 700c ) , or even 29 x 4 '' oversize all-terrain tires a pivoting-boom front-wheel drive ( pbfwd aka moving bottom bracket recumbent ) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together pbfwd bikes may have dual wheels or larger most tadpole trikes are uss in addition , some trikes such as the sidewinder have used rear-wheel steer , instead of the more common front-wheel steer another style , pivoting-boom fwd ( pbfwd ) , has the crankset connected to and moving with the front fork in addition to the much shorter chain , the advantages to pbfwd are use of a larger front wheel for lower rolling resistance without heel strike ( you can pedal while turning ) and use of the upper body when sprinting or climbing another disadvantage of pbfwd for some riders is a slightly longer '' learning curve '' due to adaptation to the pedal-steer effect ( forces applied to the pedal can actually steer the bike ) cruzbike is the only pbfwd recumbent currently in production , and features a traditional steering axis similar to most standard and recumbent bikes these can reduce aerodynamic drag and help keep the rider warmer and drier in cold and wet weather fully enclosed bikes and trikes are considered velomobiles the seats themselves are either of mesh stretched tightly over a frame or foam cushions over hard shells like the stinger pictured , which might be moulded or assembled from sheet materials the extreme reclined position , and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them , makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents highracers are generally more maneuverable than lowracers since their higher center of mass make them easier to balance at lower speeds the reasoning is that the riders body is in line with the wheels , reducing drag however , the injuries are very rare and seldom serious in order to accommodate paraplegics and other individuals with little or no use of their legs , many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes , or handcycles as well as road-going recumbent bicycles with wheels , stationary versions also exist these are often found in gyms but are also available for home use these have the same comfort advantages as road-going recumbents before the shape of the bicycle settled down following starley 's safety bicycle , there was a good deal of experimentation with various arrangements , and this included designs which might be considered recumbent this year also saw what is considered the first genuine recumbent , the fautenil v√©lociped the back-rest was adjustable on more sporting models another cyclist , paul morand , won the paris-limoges race in 1933 on one of mochet 's recumbents charles mochet died a short time after the ban was enacted , still protesting against the uci decision , and the firm continued to make recumbents under his widow and , later , georges mochet until at least 1941 for a limited number of customers georges mochet died in 2008 1970s resurgence and the ihpva company to do so from 1983 to 1991 steven roberts toured the u.s a faired avatar 2000 was the first two-wheeler to beat the european vector three-wheeler in the streamliner races in 2002 , linear manufacturing 's assets were bought by bicycle man llc and moved to new york official speed records for recumbents are governed by the rules of the international human powered vehicle association the official record for an upright bicycle under ihpva-legal conditions ( but at sea level , not high altitude ) is set by jim glover in 1986 with an english-made moulton bicycle with a usa-made hardshell fairing around him and the bike boardman 's monocoque bike was designed by mike burrows , whose windcheetah recumbent trike ( see above ) also holds the record from land 's end to john o ' groats , in 41 h 4 min 22 s with andy wilkinson riding
