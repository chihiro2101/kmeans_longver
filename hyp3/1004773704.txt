although this cage effect has been attributed to faraday 's ice pail experiment performed in 1843 , it was benjamin franklin in 1755 who observed the effect by lowering an uncharged cork ball suspended on a silk thread through an opening in an electrically charged metal can the fact is singular a continuous faraday shield is a hollow conductor jonathan chapman david p if a charge is placed inside an ungrounded faraday shield without touching the walls ( let 's denote this charge quantity as +q ) , the internal face of the shield becomes charged with -q , leading to field lines originating at the charge and extending to charges inside the inner surface of the metal thumb effectiveness of shielding of a static electric field is largely independent of the geometry of the conductive material ; however , static magnetic fields can penetrate the shield completely thus to work well at short wavelengths ( i.e sensitive components may include wireless door locks , navigation/gps systems , and lane departure warning system it is often used by shoplifters to steal rfid-tagged items elevators and other rooms with metallic conducting frames and walls simulate a faraday cage effect , leading to a loss of signal and '' dead zones '' for users of cellular phones , radios , and other electronic devices that require external electromagnetic signals some electrical linemen wear faraday suits , which allow them to work on live , high-voltage power lines without risk of electrocution faraday cage protects from 100,000 v : : physikshow uni bonn notes from physics lecture on faraday cages from michigan state university michael faraday : the invention of faraday cage background and related experiment top gear 's richard hammond is protected from 600,000 v by a car ( a faraday cage )
