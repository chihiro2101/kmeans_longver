early science and classical physics gauss 's law for magnetism , one of maxwell 's equations , is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist paul dirac , '' quantised singularities in the electromagnetic field '' lecture notes by robert littlejohn , university of california , berkeley , 2007–8 the electric charge is , in fact , quantized , which is consistent with ( but does not prove ) the existence of monopoles but they 're not magnetic monopoles poles and magnetism in ordinary matter however , in the multipole expansion of a magnetic field , the '' monopole '' term is always exactly zero ( for ordinary matter ) in an electric dipole made of ordinary matter , the positive charge is made of protons and the negative charge is made of electrons , but a magnetic dipole does not have different types of matter creating the north pole and south pole maxwell 's equations are symmetric when the charge and electric current density are zero everywhere , which is the case in vacuum if magnetic charges do not exist & nbsp ; – or if they do exist but are not present in a region of space & nbsp ; – then the new terms in maxwell 's equations are all zero , and the extended equations reduce to the conventional equations of electromagnetism such as ) ; instead , they are sources for other fields , for example the -field , the '' -field '' ( related to superfluid vorticity ) , or various other quantum fields they are not directly relevant to grand unified theories or other aspects of particle physics , and do not help explain charge quantization—except insofar as studies of analogous situations can help confirm that the mathematical analyses involved are sound there are a number of examples in condensed-matter physics where collective behavior leads to emergent phenomena that resemble magnetic monopoles in certain respects , making magnetic monopoles , and other exotica , in the lab , symmetry breaking , january 29 , 2009 one example of the work on magnetic monopole quasiparticles is a paper published in the journal science in september 2009 , in which researchers described the observation of quasiparticles resembling magnetic monopoles this research went on to win the 2012 europhysics prize for condensed matter physics by applying a magnetic-field pulse to crystal of dysprosium titanate at 0.36 k , the authors created a relaxing magnetic current that lasted for several minutes they thus derived the microscopic parameters of monopole motion in spin ice and identified the distinct roles of free and bound magnetic charges
