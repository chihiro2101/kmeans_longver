some of the more important functional sections are subdivided into subsections a mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks , such as xlr connectors for microphones and the outputs from di boxes , and 1/4 '' jacks for line level sources depending on the mixer , a channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes , turn on an attenuator pad ( often reducing the signal by 15 or 20 & nbsp ; db to prevent audio clipping ) , or activate other features , such as a high-pass filter the channel strips are typically numbered so that the audio engineer can identify the different channels dynamic range compression , gating ) , if supported routing , including direct outs , auxiliary-sends , panning ( audio ) , and subgroup assignments level-control faders ( on small mixers , these may be rotary knobs to save space ) on many consoles , these sections are color-coded for quick identification by the operator each signal ( e.g ) that is plugged into the mixer has its own channel the input/preamp conditions the signal from the external device and this controls the amount of amplification or attenuation that is applied to the input signal to bring it to a nominal level for processing to obtain a good gain structure , engineers usually raise the gain as high as they can before audio clipping results ; this helps to provide the best signal to noise ratio auxiliary sends can send the signal to an external processor such as a reverb , with the return signal routed through another channel or designated auxiliary return another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent 's headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area for example , if an audio engineer is having problems with clipping on an input , they may use sip to solely hear that channel , so that the problem can be diagnosed and addressed some higher-end consoles use voltage-controlled amplifier ( vca ) vcas function somewhat like a submix but let the operator control the level of multiple input channels with a single fader unlike subgroups , no sub-mix is created the audio signals from the assigned channels remain routed independently of vca assignments in a typical live sound mixing context , with a band playing at a venue , consisting of a rhythm section , solo instrumentalists and singers , the master control section allows the audio engineer to control the volume of the entire group with just one fader ( for monaural mixers ) or a pair of left and right faders ( for stereo mixers ) subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together on the right hand side of the mixer or , on larger consoles , in a center section flanked by banks of input channels aux returns such as those signals returning from external processors are often in the master section meters may have needles or leds . hardware routing and patching most , but not all , audio mixers can use monaural signals to produce simulated stereo sound through panning read and write console automation be interfaced with computers or other recording equipment be powered by batteries there are two primary reasons for doing this ; one , in the event of a hardware failure , a second redundant console is already in place and can be switched to ( an important feature for live broadcasts ) ; second , it allows the operators to set up two identical mix positions , one at front of house — where the audio will be mixed during a performance — and the other at some other location within the theater ( e.g yamaha sold more than 1000 pm5d mixers by july , 2005 , and other manufacturers are seeing increasing sales of their digital products most digital mixers use technology to reduce physical space requirements , entailing compromises in user interface such as a single shared channel adjustment area that is selectable for only one channel at a time some digital mixers allow offline editing of the mix , a feature that lets the traveling technician use a laptop to make anticipated changes to the show , shortening the time it takes to prepare the sound system for the artist in this respect , both formats are on par with each other many digital mixers avoid this problem by low-level gating digital circuitry is more electromagnetic interference from radio transmitters such as walkie-talkies and cell phones experienced live sound professionals agree that the selection and quality of the microphones and loudspeakers ( with their innate higher potential for creating distortion ) are a much greater source of coloration of sound than the choice of mixer the use of remote control technology can be utilized to reduce the amount of venue space used for the front of house mixing console , nicknamed '' seat-kills '' in the music industry software mixing is heavily integrated as part of a digital audio workstation among the highest quality bootleg recordings of live performances are so-called soundboard recordings sourced directly from the mixing console the most basic dj mixers have only two inputs , though some have four or more inputs for djs using a larger number of sound sources the tones generated from a no-input mixer are created by connecting an output of the mixer into an input channel and manipulating the pitch with the mixer 's dials ams neve avid behringer cadac electronics calrec crest audio d & r dhd audio digico electro-voice euphonix fairlight focusrite harrison audio consoles klotz digital lawo logitek mackie mci midas peavey phonic presonus qsc rane roland shure solid state logic ( ssl ) soundcraft speck electronics stage tec studer studiomaster tascam ward-beck systems wheatstone yamaha yorkville
