lastly , once the structures were known it became clear that new theories of chemical bonding were needed to explain them lipscomb was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1976 for his achievements in this field christopher longuet-higgins 5 years before its determination although uranium borohydride was not utilized for isotopic separations , schlesinger 's work laid the foundation for a host of boron hydride reagents for organic synthesis , most of which were developed by his student herbert c it involved : 3-center 2-electron b-h-b hydrogen bridges 3-center 2-electron b-b-b bonds 2-center 2-electron bonds ( in b-b , b-h and bh 2 ) lipscomb 's methodology has largely been superseded by a molecular orbital approach for example , in the icosahedral ion b 12 h 12 2- , the totally symmetric ( a g symmetry ) molecular orbital is equally distributed among all 12 boron atoms there are continuing efforts by theoretical chemists to improve the treatment of the bonding in boranes—an example is stone 's tensor surface harmonic treatment of cluster bonding with an alkali metal hydride , for example , : b 2 h 6 + 2 h − → 2 bh 4 − further demonstrating that they are not in general '' electron-deficient '' ( see above ) , boranes can also function as electron donors owing to the relative basic character of the low-polarity b-h terminal groups , as in reactions with halogens to form haloboranes for example , pentaborane ( 9 ) reacts with trimethylphosphine : b 5 h 9 + 2 pme 3 → b 5 h 9 ( pme 3 ) 2 producing what can be regarded as a derivative of the unknown hypho-borane b 5 h 13 acidity increases with the size of the borane boranes can function as ligands in coordination compounds
