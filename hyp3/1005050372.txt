the conditions for feedback follow the barkhausen stability criterion , namely that , with sufficiently high gain , a stable oscillation can ( and usually will ) occur in a feedback loop whose frequency is such that the phase delay is an integer multiple of 360 degrees and the gain at that frequency is equal to 1 if the gain is large , but slightly less than 1 , then high-pitched slowly decaying feedback tones will be created , but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system , such as through a microphone behavior of sound system response immediately below feedback , cp boner , j additionally , the loudspeakers and microphones should have non-uniform directivity and should stay out of the maximum sensitivity of each other , ideally at a direction of cancellation many professional sound engineers can identify feedback frequencies by ear but others use a real time analyzer to identify the ringing frequency to intentionally create feedback , an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet , with very high gain ( amplification ) and/or the guitar brought near the speaker '' ' i feel fine ' song review '' , allmusic.com the who 's 1965 hits '' anyway , anyhow , anywhere '' and '' my generation '' featured feedback manipulation by pete townshend , with an extended solo in the former and the shaking of his guitar in front of the amplifier to create a throbbing noise in the latter in 1963 , the teenage brian may and his father custom-built his signature guitar red special , which was purposely designed to feed back reno : carson street publishing , 1995 examples of feedback combined with a quick volume swell used as a transition include weezer 's '' my name is jonas '' and '' say it ai n't so '' ; the strokes ' '' reptilia '' , '' new york city cops '' , and '' juicebox '' ; dream theater 's '' as i am '' ; as well as numerous tracks by meshuggah and tool hodgson ( 2010 ) , p.122-123 . examples in modern classical music though closed circuit feedback was a prominent feature in many early experimental electronic music compositions , it was contemporary american composer robert ashley who first used acoustic feedback as sound material in his work the wolfman ( 1964 ) 84 and alvin lucier van eck ( 2017 ) , p 159 anne wellmer , van eck ( 2017 ) , p 93 adam basanta , lesley flanigan , ronald boersen and erfan abdi audio feedback became a signature feature of many underground rock bands during the 1980s
