( 2020 ) many transformers come with tech specs ( short for technical specifications ) printed on the back of the box that they are sold in each specification is rated by a value from 1 to 10 , 1 being the lowest , and 10 being the highest teams have teamwork ratings instead of ranks the specifications portion of the tech specs which came with earlier g1 transformers were obfuscated with interference patterns which made them difficult to read without a decoder which was included in the box for each transformer transformers : generation one ( 1984–1990 usa , 1984–1993 uk/canada ) it is thought that hasbro europe as it now stands did not come into existence till 1985 , hence no records of transformers sales in 1984 the autobot jetfire was repainted from a macross toy , specifically the vf-1 valkyrie , and the character was renamed skyfire in the animated television series program for copyright reasons in 1986 the transformers animated movie had been released , and during the run of the movie , through a pamphlet that came with certain figures , you could order certain transformers through the mail , such as optimus prime among other toys this was due to changes in the movie and television series , which leaped ahead twenty years to the year 2005 ( examples : sunstorm , hauler , detritus , and the like the subgroups concept was done away with for the first year , but there were no new molds or characters generation 2 re-used the molds for many of the characters from the 1984 and 1985 line , but with mostly different color schemes and finishes , as well as different weapons and accessories most of the 1994 figures were re-releases or recolors of european g1 releases there were toys planned that never saw release a fresh idea coupled with a tv series program with strong stories assured this series the success hasbro and takara needed , as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in takara 's home market , japan hasbro 's original plan for the beast wars was to have optimus prime , renamed optimus primal , and megatron be reformatted versions of their 1980s selves the transformers ' fan base splintered into two groups as a direct result , with the one enjoying beast wars for what it was and the other refusing to accept it as official canon in the transformers mythology like beast wars , the name transformers was used only as a secondary title in 2000 , car robots was released the combaticons that formed bruticus were the first of the decepticons to be introduced into the show along with scourge , who as a toy was a black repaint of g2 laser prime also of note , megatron 's toy was repainted and re-released ( retooled to allow 4 new altmodes ) under the name galvatron , beginning a tradition of repaints that would follow through with armada and subsequent toy lines transformers : armada ( 2002–2003 ) after several lines of toys produced by one company or the other , hasbro and takara united to produce what was purported to be a single , identical line of transformers for release worldwide in tandem with this new endeavor , armada signaled a new continuity in its accompanying animated series and a new focus in both the show and the toys on mini-cons , a new faction of transformers unicron is a robot who transforms into an entire planet this line was revitalized in 2008 with new molds and the introduction of various sub-series from previous popular transformers lines like classics transformers : energon ( 2003–2005 ) energon weapons and chips came in a variety of colors of translucent plastic many autobot figures in the line were able to combine with a partner to form a larger robot through the '' powerlinx '' process thus , several inconsistencies exist many of the repaints taken from the armada line had remolded parts retro-fitted to the original designs so their mini-con features would now use a planet key instead the line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the transformers : universe line kiss players is set in an alternate transformers universe where the transformers are powered by the kisses of young girls the toys themselves come packaged with small , scale figurines of the girls who power them the comic that accompanied the kiss players was an unashamed reflection of this , with several images which were considered by some to be very sexually themed on july 3 , 2007 , a joint collaboration among dreamworks skg , paramount pictures and hasbro a new origin and characters were introduced steven spielberg , who with jeffrey katzenberg and david geffen had established dreamworks skg , was the main executive producer of the film , with lorenzo di bonaventura , tom desanto and don murphy serving as co-executive producers reactions varied widely : some fans objected strongly to the designs , occasionally going so far as to threaten a boycott if the designs were not changed to be more traditional , while others liked them the robots ( stated by optimus prime ) in the film are actual sentient organisms and not just giant , mindless , and mechanical machines the autobots and decepticons , while fighting in space for possession of the allspark , crash-landed onto a futuristic earth and resume their battle after laying dormant for years darth vader turns into his custom tie fighter while luke skywalker turns into an x-wing jango fett and boba fett become slave i , and commander cody turns into a turbo tank there are more star wars characters into transformers like general grievous and obi-wan kenobi star wars transformers transformers wiki spider-man becomes a helicopter , wolverine turns into a 4wd , venom turns into a turbocharged retro car transformers : disney label ( 2009 ) the first line of the toy series is the mickey mouse transformer which was modeled after optimus prime with the same colors as its transformer counterpart and can transform into a cartoonish trailer truck like the original version ralston marketed many breakfast cereals based on cartoons in the 80s and 90s the box claims the cereal had '' more taste than meets the eye '' and also had the ability to '' transform ordinary milk into chocolate flavored milk '' the first larger transformers convention in the nordic countries is called '' the ntfa mini-con '' , with official support from hasbro nordic , and was held by members of the ntfa - the nordic transfans association , for the first time on november 3–4 , 2007 it featured simon furman as a guest of honour initial inaugurees presented at botcon 2010 ceremonies included
