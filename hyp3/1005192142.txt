atmospheric moisture reduces , or attenuates , the strength of uhf signals over long distances , and the attenuation increases with frequency occasionally when conditions are right , uhf radio waves can travel long distances by tropospheric ducting as the atmosphere warms and cools throughout the day higher gain omnidirectional uhf antennas can be made of collinear arrays of dipoles and are used for mobile base stations and sector antenna the short wavelengths also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small at the top end of the band slot antennas and parabolic dishes become practical uhf channels are still used for digital television this allows mobile phones and mobile computing devices to be connected to the public switched telephone network and the internet wi-fi operates at 2412 mhz-2484 mhz lte also operates on uhf frequencies 694-790 & nbsp ; mhz : i.e a complete list of us television frequency allocations can be found at north american television frequencies there is a considerable amount of lawful unlicensed activity ( cordless phones , wireless networking ) clustered around 900 & nbsp ; mhz and 2.4 & nbsp ; ghz , regulated under title 47 cfr part 15 in 2009 , as part of the digital television switch-off time announced , the spectrum from 698 & nbsp ; mhz to 806 & nbsp ; mhz ( uhf channels 52â€“69 ) was removed from tv broadcasting , making it available for other uses the fcc did not include a wholesale condition , which would have required the owner of the band to resell bandwidth to third parties who could then service the end user a , b , c 15 & nbsp ; mhz ; d , e , f , g , h 5 & nbsp ; mhz 2000 & ndash ; 2020 & nbsp ; mhz : lower aws-4 downlink ( mobile broadband ) 2020 & ndash ; 2110 & nbsp ; mhz : cable antenna relay service , local television transmission service , tv broadcast auxiliary service , earth exploration satellite service 2110 & ndash ; 2200 & nbsp ; mhz : aws mobile broadband downlink 2110 & ndash ; 2155 & nbsp ; mhz : aws-1 blocks a , b , c , d , e , f 2155 & ndash ; 2180 & nbsp ; mhz : aws-3 blocks g , h , i , j 2180 & ndash ; 2200 & nbsp ; mhz : upper aws-4 2200 & ndash ; 2290 & nbsp ; mhz : nasa satellite tracking , telemetry and control ( space-to-earth , space-to-space ) 2290 & ndash ; 2300 & nbsp ; mhz : nasa deep space network 2300 & ndash ; 2305 & nbsp ; mhz : amateur radio ( 13 cm band , lower segment ) 2305 & ndash ; 2315 & nbsp ; mhz : wcs mobile broadband service uplink blocks a and b 2315 & ndash ; 2320 & nbsp ; mhz : wcs block c ( at & t is pursuing smart grid deployment ) 2320 & ndash ; 2345 & nbsp ; mhz : satellite radio ( sirius xm ) 2345 & ndash ; 2350 & nbsp ; mhz : wcs block d ( at & t is pursuing smart grid deployment ) 2350 & ndash ; 2360 & nbsp ; mhz : wcs mobile broadband service downlink blocks a and b 2360 & ndash ; 2390 & nbsp ; mhz : aircraft landing and safety systems 2390 & ndash ; 2395 & nbsp ; mhz : aircraft landing and safety systems ( secondary deployment in a dozen of airports ) , amateur radio otherwise 2395 & ndash ; 2400 & nbsp ; mhz : amateur radio ( 13 cm band , upper segment ) 2400 & ndash ; 2483.5 & nbsp ; mhz : ism , ieee 802.11 , 802.11b , 802.11g , 802.11n wireless lan , ieee 802.15.4-2006 , bluetooth , radio-controlled aircraft ( strictly for spread spectrum use ) , microwave ovens , zigbee 2483.5 & ndash ; 2495 & nbsp ; mhz : globalstar downlink and terrestrial low power service suitable for td-lte small cells 2495 & ndash ; 2690 & nbsp ; mhz : educational broadcast and broadband radio services 2690 & ndash ; 2700 & nbsp ; mhz : receive-only range for radio astronomy and space research ik1qfk home page ( vlf.it ) .
