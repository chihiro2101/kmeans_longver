chimeras can often breed , but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes ; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male as such , they can be male , female , or have mixed intersex characteristics this has occurred in humans , and at one time was thought to be extremely rare although more recent evidence suggests that this is not the case hackensack , nj ; london : world scientific publishing co 95 % of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through chorionic fusions , making them hematopoietic chimeras if the blastocysts are of opposite sex , genitals of both sexes may be formed : either ovary and testis , or combined ovotestes , in one rare form of intersex , a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line , and the internal organs of the other cell line the most noticeable are some male tortoiseshell cats and calico cats ( although most male tortoiseshells have an extra x chromosome responsible for the colouration ) or animals with ambiguous sex organs the lydia fairchild case , for example , was brought to court after dna testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers the charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that lydia was a chimera , with the matching dna being found in her cervical tissue microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual however , his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin , and it is unknown whether microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells ( for example , sperm and egg cells ) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own another report of a human chimera was published in 1998 , where a male human had some partially developed female organs due to chimerism he had been conceived by in-vitro fertilization swabs from his lips , cheek and tongue showed mixed dna content in 2008 , a man was killed in a traffic accident that occurred in seoul , south korea there are usually no signs or symptoms for chimerism other than a few physical symptoms such as hyperpigmentation , hypopigmentation , or possessing two different colored eyes it was discovered that one of these primates , roku , was a sexual chimera ; as four percent of roku 's blood cells contained two x chromosomes on january 22 , 2019 the national society of genetic counselors released an article — chimerism explained : how one person can unknowingly have two sets of dna , where they state “ tetragametic chimerism , where a twin pregnancy evolves into one child , is currently believed to be one of the rarer forms chimerism has been found in some species of marine sponges in the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera , chimerism can be later found in the epiblast , primitive endoderm , and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst es cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper if embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera , the following procedure is common : a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse , by way of electroporation ; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance , provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting ; and be able to be positively selected for chimera mouse production by blastocyst injection , wellcome trust sanger institute , this same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of es cells and diploid embryos , diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit , to these wells es cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage , and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse well-known examples of a graft-chimera are laburnocytisus 'adamii ' , caused by a fusion of a laburnum and a broom , and '' family '' trees , where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree appel , jacob m lee ( scientific american , february 2008 ) weiss , rick ( february 13 , 2005 ) denies patent for a too-human hybrid national library of medicine , national institute of health
