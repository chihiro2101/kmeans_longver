moreover , robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory , a small fragment of zfc this much is certain — zfc is immune to the classic paradoxes of naive set theory : russell 's paradox , the burali-forti paradox , and cantor 's paradox the independence is usually proved by forcing , whereby it is shown that every countable transitive model of zfc ( sometimes augmented with large cardinal axioms ) can be expanded to satisfy the statement in question forcing proves that the following statements are independent of zfc : continuum hypothesis diamondsuit suslin 's problem martin 's axiom ( which is not a zfc axiom ) axiom of constructibility ( which is also not a zfc axiom ) martin 's axiom plus the negation of the continuum hypothesis implies the suslin hypothesis , that the axiom of choice is independent of zf however , we can use forcing to create a model which contains a suitable submodel , namely one satisfying zf but not c : for criticism of set theory in general , see objections to set theory zfc has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak , as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the universal set saunders mac lane and solomon feferman have both made this point unlike von neumann–bernays–gödel set theory ( nbg ) and morse–kelley set theory ( mk ) , zfc does not admit the existence of proper classes there are numerous list of statements undecidable in zfc these include the continuum hypothesis , the whitehead problem , and the moore space ( topology )
