for example , a small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in pmma grades destined for heat processing , since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization ( '' unzipping '' ) during processing the polymer of methyl acrylate , pma or poly ( methyl acrylate ) , is similar to poly ( methyl methacrylate ) , except for the lack of methyl groups on the backbone carbon chain polymethyl acrylate and polyethyl acrylate , encyclop√¶dia britannica the larger circular clear black area represents the larger outer side of the thick one-piece plastic cone '' window '' modern aircraft transparencies often use stretched acrylic plies laser cut acrylic panels have been used to redirect sunlight into a light pipe or tubular skylight and , from there , to spread it into a room medical technologies and implants meyers , '' molecular biology and biotechnology : a comprehensive desk reference '' , wiley-vch , 1995 , p 722 ridley had a lens manufactured by the rayner company ( brighton & hove , east sussex ) made from perspex polymerised by ici pmma as a soft tissue filler was widely used in the beginning of the century to restore volume in patients with hiv-related facial wasting pressure is used during the curing process to minimize polymerization shrinkage , ensuring an accurate fit of the prosthesis acrylic paint essentially consists of pmma suspended in water ; however since pmma is hydrophobe , a substance with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups needs to be added to facilitate the suspension modern furniture makers , especially in the 1960s and 1970s , seeking to give their products a space age aesthetic , incorporated lucite and other pmma products into their designs , especially office chairs this is done for its relatively low cost , light weight , shatter-resistance , aesthetics and because it can be ordered in larger sizes than standard picture framing glass my life with jan pmma , in the commercial form technovit 7200 is used vastly in the medical field the type of acrylic used in tanning beds is most often formulated from a special type of polymethyl methacrylate , a compound that allows the passage of ultraviolet rays sheets of pmma are commonly used in the sign industry to make flat cut out letters in thicknesses typically varying from ) it is used as a light guide for the backlights in tft lcd patterns on this can be made by an electron beam ( using an electron microscope ) , deep uv light ( shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process ) , or x-rays exposure to these creates chain scission or ( de-cross-linking ) within the pmma , allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer , making it a positive photoresist a blacklight-reactive tattoo ink using pmma microcapsules has been developed printing of solar cells in the 1960s , luthier dan armstrong developed a line of electric guitars and basses whose bodies were made completely of acrylic these instruments were marketed under the ampeg brand perspex technical properties perspex material safety data sheet ( msds )
