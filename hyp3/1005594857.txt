the vlt consists of an arrangement of four large ( 8.2 metre diameter ) telescopes ( called unit telescopes or uts ) with optical elements that can combine them into an astronomical interferometer ( vlti ) , which is used to resolve small objects these ats were installed and became operational between 2004 and 2007 the instrumentation required to obtain a combined incoherent focus was not originally built this is comparable to the resolution achieved using other arrays such as the navy prototype optical interferometer and the chara array unlike many earlier optical and infrared interferometers , the astronomical multi-beam recombiner ( amber ) instrument on vlti was initially designed to perform coherent integration ( which requires signal-to-noise greater than one in each atmospheric coherence time ) in spectroscopic mode , the vlti can currently reach a magnitude of 1.5 only targets which are at temperatures of more than 1,000Â°c have a surface brightness high enough to be observed in the mid-infrared , and objects must be at several thousands of degrees celsius for near-infrared observations using the vlti after falling drastically behind schedule and failing to meet some specifications , in december 2004 the vlt interferometer became the target of a second eso '' recovery plan '' in march 2011 , the pionier instrument for the first time simultaneously combined the light of the four unit telescopes , potentially making vlti the biggest optical telescope in the world however , this attempt was not really a success it is a true oasis and the perfect hide out for dominic greene , our villain , whom 007 is tracking in our new james bond film cerro tololo inter-american observatory european extremely large telescope extremely large telescope la silla observatory list of largest optical reflecting telescopes llano de chajnantor observatory mauna kea observatories overwhelmingly large telescope paranal observatory roque de los muchachos observatory
