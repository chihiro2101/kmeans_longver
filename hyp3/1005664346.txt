binding to the lipid bilayer some proteins , such as g-proteins and certain protein kinases , interact with transmembrane proteins and the lipid bilayer simultaneously the boundary region between the hydrophobic inner core and the hydrophilic interfacial regions is very narrow , at around 3å , ( see lipid bilayer article for a description of its component chemical groups ) some water-soluble proteins associate with lipid bilayers irreversibly and can form transmembrane alpha-helical or beta-barrel channels these may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions on the exoplasmic face of the cell membrane , lipid anchored proteins are covalently attached to the lipids glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) and cholesterol electrostatic interactions are strongly dependent on the ionic strength of the solution orientations and penetration depths of many amphitropic proteins and peptides in membranes are studied using site-directed spin labeling , chemical labeling , measurement of membrane binding affinities of protein mutants , fluorescence spectroscopy , solution or solid-state nmr spectroscopy , atr ftir spectroscopy , x-ray or neutron diffraction , and computational methods the binding is usually a strongly exothermic reaction intrinsically unstructured or unfolded peptides with nonpolar residues or lipid anchors can also penetrate the interfacial region of the membrane and reach the hydrocarbon core , especially when such peptides are cationic and interact with negatively charged membranes in biological membranes ( eds & nbsp ; 159–188 benga ) boca raton crc press , 1985
