v dc ) file : lrt station south campus squared.jpg overhead lines on the edmonton capital line file : roofride kyiv.jpg 3 kv dc overhead catenary in kiev electric trains that collect their current from overhead lines use a device such as a pantograph , bow collector or trolley pole current collectors are electrically conductive and allow current to flow through to the train or tram and back to the feeder station through the steel wheels on one or both running rails non-electric locomotives ( such as diesels ) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line , although there may be difficulties with structure gauge compound equipment uses a second support wire , known as the '' auxiliary '' , between the messenger/catenary wire and the contact wire modern systems use current-carrying droppers , eliminating the need for separate wires a somewhat higher tension than used before clipping the beam yielded a deflected profile for the wire that could be easily handled at by a pneumatic servo pantograph with only 3 & nbsp ; g acceleration ) the circuit is completed by using both wires parallel overhead wires are also used on the rare railways with three-phase ac railway electrification in the soviet union the following types of wires/cables were used all the 19 strands could be of the same metal or some strands could be of steel for strength with the remaining strands of aluminum or copper for conductivity москва '' транспорт '' 1976 p 54 another type looked like it had all copper wires but inside each wire was a steel core for strength either method is known as '' auto-tensioning '' ( at ) or '' constant tension '' and ensures that the tension is virtually independent of temperature tension length has a maximum a tension length can be seen as a fixed centre point , with the two half-tension lengths expanding and contracting with temperature for bow collectors and pantographs , this is done by having two contact wires run side by side over the length between 2 or 4 wire supports in normal service , the two sections are electrically connected ; depending on the system this might be an isolator , fixed contact or a booster transformer ) neutral section ( phase break ) this is not a problem for dc systems the presence of the earthed section in the middle is to ensure that should the transducer controlled apparatus fail , and the driver also fail to shut off power , the energy in the arc struck by the pantograph as it passes to the neutral section is conducted to earth , operating substation circuit breakers , rather than the arc either bridging the insulators into a section made dead for maintenance , a section fed from a different phase , or setting up a backdoor connection between different parts of the country 's national grid to prevent arcing , power must be switched off before reaching the gap and usually the pantograph would be lowered when the bridge is fully closed , the motor of the rotary overlap is operated to turn it from a tilted position into the horizontal position , connecting the conductor rails at the transition end section and the bridge together to supply power close to the junction on each side , the tram wire turns into a solid bar running parallel to the trolleybus wires for about half a metre some crossings between tramway/light rail and railways are extant in germany in zürich , switzerland , vbz trolleybus line 32 has a level crossing with the 1,200 v dc uetliberg railway line ; at many places , trolleybus lines cross the tramway melbourne has three level crossings between electrified suburban railways and tram lines amalias avenue and vas in milan , most tram lines cross trolleybuses in milan once or twice trolleybus and tram wires run parallel in streets such as viale stelvio , viale umbria and viale tibaldi the neutral was not used these were an experimental railway line of siemens in berlin-lichtenberg in 1898 ( length 1.8 kilometres ) , the military railway between marienfelde and zossen between 1901 and 1904 ( length 23.4 kilometres ) and an 800-metre-long section of a coal railway near cologne between 1940 and 1949 on dc systems , bipolar overhead lines were sometimes used to avoid galvanic corrosion of metallic parts near the railway , such as on the chemin de fer de la mure the catenary or messenger wire is hung at a specific tension between line structures , and a second wire is held in tension by the messenger wire , attached to it at frequent intervals by clamps and connecting wires known as droppers for amtrak 's inter-city trains in cleveland , ohio the rta rapid transit lines and the heavy rail line use the same overhead wires , due to a city ordinance intended to limit air pollution from the large number of steam trains that passed through cleveland between the east coast and chicago . problems with overhead equipment during cold or frosty weather , ice may coat overhead lines this can result in poor electrical contact between the collector and the overhead line , resulting in electrical arcing and power surges while a conventional rail line requires only the grade , ballast , ties and rails , an overhead system also requires a complex system of support structures , lines , insulators , power-control systems and power lines , all of which require maintenance a protest group with their own website has been formed the trams had bipolar overhead lines , consisting of two u-pipes , in which the pantographs hung and ran like shuttles
