debating the exact boundaries between hejaz and najd in particular , but generally set the western boundaries of najd to be wherever the western mountain ranges and lava beds began to slope eastwards , and set the eastern boundaries of najd at the narrow strip of red sand dunes known as the ad-dahna desert , some east of modern-day riyadh the eastern sections ( historically better known as al-yamama ) are marked by oasis settlements with much farming and trading activities , while the rest has traditionally been sparsely occupied by nomadic bedouins جريدة الرياض – عين على القصيم smaller

variation , however , is far less pronounced in najd than it is elsewhere in the country , and the najdi sedentary dialect seems to be descended from the arabic dialects , just as most sedentary najdis are descendants of nomadic bedouins themselves this character goes under the name najd .
