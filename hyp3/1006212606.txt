the afrikaans name drakensberge comes from the name the earliest dutch settlers gave to the escarpment , namely drakensbergen , or dragons ' mountains encyclopædia britannica ( 1975 ) ; macropaedia , vol helen hemingway benton publishers , chicago because of the extensive erosion of the plateau , which occurred throughout most of the mesozoic and cenozoic eras , none of its surface rocks ( except the kalahari sands ) are younger than 180 & nbsp ; million years council for geoscience , geological survey of south africa the erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coast to its present position , means that the rocks of the coastal plain are , with very few and small exceptions , older than those that cap the top of the escarpment in the main , the rocks of the kwazulu-natal midlands belong to the beaufort and ecca groups ( of the karoo supergroup ) , aged 220–310 & nbsp ; million years , and are therefore considerably older than the drakensberg lavas ( aged 180 & nbsp ; million years ) that cap the escarpment on the border between kwazulu-natal and lesotho the absence of the great escarpment for approximately to the north of tzaneen ( to reappear on the border between zimbabwe and mozambique in the chimanimani mountains ) is due to a failed westerly branch of the main rift that caused antarctica to start drifting away from southern africa during the breakup of gondwana about 150 million years ago it is possible that recent climate change has diminished the intensity of periglaciation the geological composition of drakensberg ( escarpment wall ) varies considerably along its more than 1000 & nbsp ; km length the limpopo and mpumalanga drakensberg are capped by an erosion resistant quartzite layer that is part of the transvaal supergroup , which also forms the magaliesberg to the north and northwest of pretoria these steep slopes are the most southerly high mountains in africa , and being farther from the equator provide cooler habitats at lower elevations than most mountain ranges on the continent the grassland is of interest as it contains a great number of endemic plants there are 24 species of snakes in the drakensberg , two of which are highly venomous one bird is endemic to the high peaks , the mountain pipit ( anthus hoeschi ) , and another six species are found mainly here : bush blackcap ( lioptilus nigricapillus ) , buff-streaked chat ( oenanthe bifasciata ) , rudd 's lark ( heteromirafra ruddi ) , drakensberg rockjumper ( chaetops aurantius ) , yellow-breasted pipit ( anthus chloris ) , and drakensberg siskin ( serinus symonsi ) other endemic species include three frogs found in the mountain streams , drakensberg river frog ( amietia dracomontana ) , phofung river frog ( amietia vertebralis ) , and maluti river frog ( amietia umbraculata ) the lower slopes of the drakensberg support much wildlife , perhaps most importantly the rare southern white rhinoceros ( which was nurtured here when facing extinction ) and the black wildebeest ( connochaetes gnou , which only thrives in protected areas and game reserves ) adjacent to the ukhahlamba drakensberg world heritage site is the 1900 ha allendale mountain reserve , which is the largest private reserve adjoining the world heritage site and is found in the accessible kamberg area , the heart of the historic san rock art of the ukhahlamba many of these caves have paintings by the san ( bushmen ) some 20,000 individual rock paintings have been recorded at 500 different caves and overhanging sites between the drakensberg royal natal national park and bushman 's nek paint chips at least a thousand years older have also been found
