production of the standard version started , it was also decided to add an optical range-finding system for better long-range gunnery , which required the turret to be somewhat taller , and added '' bumps '' on either side of the turret to mount the optics for triangulation the rubber blocks could be easily replaced with metal x-shaped crampons for movement on ice and snow in the winter the next

to the next classification , military loading class 60 ( tonnes ) , and a new design effort was started , with the spaced armour replaced with a much denser perforated armour assemblage the new design would go on to augment and , after the cold war , sometimes replace the leopard in many countries ' armies in 2010 , the 2nd/4th lancers was disbanded around 40 leopard 1a5 ( be ) are kept operational
