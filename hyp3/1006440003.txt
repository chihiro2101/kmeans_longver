therefore , they require to start with an interval such that the function takes opposite signs at the end points of the interval the simplest root-finding algorithm is the bisection method false position ( regula falsi ) the false position method , also called the regula falsi method , is similar to the bisection method , but instead of using bisection search 's middle of the interval it uses the -intercept of the line that connects the plotted function values at the endpoints of the interval , that is : c \frac , that is a slower convergence than with three steps of newton 's method finding roots in pairs if the given polynomial only has real coefficients , one may wish to avoid computations with complex numbers several fast tests exist that tell if a segment of the real line or a region of the complex plane contains no roots the splitting circle method uses fft-based polynomial transformations to find large-degree factors corresponding to clusters of roots methods for finding all complex roots , such as aberth method can provide the real roots having isolating interval , one may use fast numerical methods , such as newton 's method for improving the precision of the result an efficient method to compute this factorization is yun 's algorithm
