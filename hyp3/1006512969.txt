of the biological treatment processes , the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml of waste activated sludge , and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process : 60–100 & nbsp ; kg/ml in a review article published in 2012 , it was reported that a total amount of 10.1 million tn ds/year were produced in eu-27 countries kelessidis and stasinakis , 2012 production of sewage sludge can be reduced by conversion from flush toilets to dry toilets such as urine-diverting dry toilets and composting toilets bacteria in class a sludge products can actually regrow under certain environmental conditions they can become concentrated in sewage sludge each of these disposal options comes with myriad potential & nbsp ; — and in some cases proven & nbsp ; — human health and environment impacts 524-525 , august 2015 , p silver is present to the degree of 20 & nbsp ; mg/kg of sludge , on average , while some sludges have up to 200 milligrams of silver per kilogram of sludge ; one outlier demonstrated a silver lode of 800–900 & nbsp ; mg per kg of sludge scdhec issued emergency regulatory order banning all pcb laden sewage sludge from being land applied on farm fields or deposited into landfills in south carolina the components of sludge have pollutant limits defined by the epa in the united states , the following classes of sewage sludge after treatment are defined : class a sludge is typically dried and pasteurized , and is also known as '' exceptional '' quality sewage sludge deposition in landfills can circulate human-virulent species of cryptosporidium and giardia pathogens biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage treatment that is to be used in agriculture some of these chemicals , including potential endocrine disruptor triclosan , can also travel through the soil column and leach into agricultural tile drainage at detectable levels other studies , however , have shown that these chemicals remain adsorbed to surface soil particles , making them more susceptible to surface erosion than infiltration switzerland , sweden , austria , and others introduced a ban the number of reported s aureus infections was 25 times as high as in hospitalized patients , a high-risk group harrison and oakes suggest that , in particular , '' until investigations are carried out that answer these questions ( ) , land application of class b sludges should be viewed as a practice that subjects neighbors and workers to substantial risk of disease in 2006 , the predicted sewage sludge growth rate was 10 million tons of sewage sludge per year '' however , they can not be disposed of in a sludge only landfill under part 503.23 because of high chromium levels and boundary restrictions biosolids that meet the class b pathogen treatment and pollutant criteria , in accordance with the epa '' standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge '' ( 40 cfr part 503 ) , can be land applied with formal site restrictions and strict record keeping in 1924 , to relieve a dismal condition in new york harbor , new york city began dumping sludge at sea at a location in the new york bight called the 12-mile site in 1986 , sludge dumping was moved still further seaward to a site over the deep ocean called the 106-mile site then , again in response to political pressure arising from events unrelated to ocean dumping , the practice ended entirely in 1992 after the 1991 congressional ban on ocean dumping , the u.s environmental protection agency ( epa ) instituted a policy of digested sludge reuse on agricultural land the epa 's part 503 regulations were developed with input from university , epa , and usda researchers from around the country and involved an extensive review of the scientific literature and the largest risk assessment the agency had conducted to that time court cases in the united states rosendall was the former president of synagro of michigan , a subsidiary of synagro technologies his duties included obtaining the approval of the city of detroit to process and dispose of the city 's wastewater a battle between the home rule of local government and states rights/commerce rights has been waged between the small town of kern county , ca and los angeles , ca in 2013 in pennsylvania , the case gilbert vs '' biosolids applied to land : advancing standards and practices '' , national research council , july 2002
