dating from around 4000 & nbsp ; bc , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , sharples ( 1991a ) , p sharples ( 1991a ) , pp the purpose of neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear , and they probably had a variety of functions sharples ( 1991a ) , p there are around 31 & nbsp ; hill forts in dorset ; archaeologist sharples , who undertook excavations at maiden castle , proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community this is supported by cunliffe , who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to maiden castle and danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 & nbsp ; bc , the first hill fort at maiden castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch the hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the south winterborne valley , which feeds the river frome the highest point is the neighbouring hog hill , which is only higher the defences were high and consisted of the v-shaped ditch and a rampart however , nearby poundbury and chalbury date to the same period , so through comparison it is possible to infer the early iron age activity at maiden castle image : maiden castle dorset ramparts.jpg thumb left 300px maiden castle 's southern defences were made up of four ramparts and three ditches in the early iron age , maiden castle was generally unexceptional ; it was one of over 100 & nbsp ; hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now berkshire , dorset , hampshire , and wiltshire & nbsp ; 11 , & nbsp ; 83 millett ( 2003 ) , p scarre ( 1998 ) , p and one of the largest in europe the area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch , with the bank standing high although the ditch was shallow cunliffe ( 1983 ) , pp the emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries , possibly through warfare this is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts ( the technical term for which is '' multivallate '' ) were likely to be not just defensive ; so many ditches and ramparts , such as those at maiden castle , were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority payne , corney , & cunliffe ( 2007 ) , p a shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source little evidence has been discovered for houses in maiden castle during the site 's reconstruction in the 5th century & nbsp ; bc ; this is probably because the site has not been fully excavated and a quarry used to provide material for the rampart may have obliterated the evidence the later houses appear to be organised in rows , and to be roughly similar in size , a reorganisation which indicates the increasing power of the elites over iron age society bronze objects such as pins , jewellery , and rivets have been found on the site , dating from the middle iron age as there was no local source of tin and copper ore , this demonstrates long distance trade , probably with the southwest early in the iron age , most of the pottery found at maiden castle was produced locally & nbsp ; – within about & nbsp ; – however later on sources further afield became more important , and by the late iron age 95 % of the pottery came from the area around poole harbour , more than away & nbsp ; 5–7 the developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites , whose power was based on agriculture around 100 & nbsp ; bc , maiden castle 's organised street pattern was replaced by more random habitation also during the late iron age , some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance , and into the areas between the banks including one body with a roman catapult bolt in its back . roman activity and abandonment mattingly ( 2006 ) , p although there is a layer of charcoal , it is associated with the iron works , and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort although 14 & nbsp ; bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death , there is no evidence that they died at maiden castle many 1st-century roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort according to the ancient geographer ptolemy , writing in the 2nd century & nbsp ; ad , dunium was the main settlement of the durotriges although dunium has long been thought to refer to maiden castle , hod hill and hengistbury have been identified as two other possible sites for dunium wainwright & cunliffe ( 1985 ) , p mills ( 1977 ) , p alternatively , the name may derive from the brittonic mai-dun , meaning a '' great hill '' dorset natural history and archaeological society ( 1922 ) , p a more recent explanation has been advanced by richard coates suggesting that the name is only of medieval origin , and was applied simultaneously to the considerable number of identically named locations around the country & nbsp ; 267f latham ( 2004 ) , p john cowper powys wrote a novel titled maiden castle in 1936 , which was set in dorset cunliffe ( 1983 ) , p under the auspices of english heritage , repair work and archaeological investigations were undertaken concurrently techniques such as radiocarbon dating were available to sharples that were unavailable to wheeler , allowing the site to be dated today , the site is in the civil parish of winterborne monkton at in 1921 , the english composer john ireland ( 18791962 ) wrote the tone poem mai-dun , a symphonic rhapsody about the place , adopting hardy 's name for it
