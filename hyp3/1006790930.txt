in common language , this is equivalent to saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement , then the consequent n must be true—if s is to be true ( see third column of '' truth table '' immediately below ) the logical relation between p and q is expressed as '' if p , then q '' and denoted '' p ⇒ q '' ( p implies q ) ; example 1 : for it to be true that '' john is a bachelor '' , it is necessary that it be also true that he is : unmarried , : male , : adult , : since to state '' john is a bachelor '' implies john has each of those three additional predicates the thunder does not cause the lightning ( since lightning causes thunder ) , but because lightning always comes with thunder , we say that thunder is necessary for lightning that is , if you are a senator , it follows that you must be at least 30 years old it is also necessary that s include a special element e such that for every x in s , it is the case that e \star x and x \star e both equal x it may be the case that several sufficient conditions , when taken together , constitute a single necessary condition ( i.e three other sufficient conditions are that the center of the card be marked with a single diamond ( ♦ ) , heart ( ♥ ) , or club ( ♣ ) a condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other another facet of this duality is that , as illustrated above , conjunctions ( using '' and '' ) of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency , while disjunctions ( using '' or '' ) of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity for a third facet , identify every mathematical predicate n with the set t ( n ) of objects , events , or statements for which n holds true ; then asserting the necessity of n for s is equivalent to claiming that t ( n ) is a superset of t ( s ) , while asserting the sufficiency of s for n is equivalent to claiming that t ( s ) is a subset of t ( n ) equivalently , it may be understood to say that p and q is necessary for the other , p \rightarrow q \land q \rightarrow p , which can also be stated as each is sufficient for or implies the other and for any graph to be bipartite , it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length cycles a philosopher stanford university primer , 2006 contexts in which extension is all that matters are , naturally , called extensional , while contexts in which extension is not enough are intensional mathematics is typically extensional throughout invalid forms of argument ( i.e
