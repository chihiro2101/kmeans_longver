the reentry module of the soyuz was replaced with an unpressurized propellant and refueling compartment with ducting along the outside of the spacecraft a small amount of weight is saved due to the lack of automatic rescue crews system and lack of parachutes progress-m 11f615a55 ( 1989-2009 ) the first 43 flights all went to mir ; following mir 's re-entry , progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the international space station the progress m is essentially the same spacecraft as the progress , but it features improvements based on the soyuz-t and soyuz-tm designs launch mass : 7,130 kg cargo mass : 2,600 kg dry cargo mass : 1,500 kg liquid cargo mass : 1,540 kg length : 7.23 m diameter of cargo modules : 2.2 m maximum diameter : 2.72 m dry cargo compartment volume : 7.6 mÂ³ solar array span : 10.6 m the first spacecraft of this series was progress m-01m progress m1 ( 2000-2004 ) progress m1 is another variant , capable of carrying more propellant ( but less total cargo ) to the space station there have been 11 of these flights progress ms is an improved variant which first launched on 21 december 2015 it has the following improvements : new external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites replacement of the kurs a with kurs na digital system the first of these , named jules verne , was launched at 04:03 utc on 9 march 2008 nasa 's planned orion spacecraft was initially designed to have an uncrewed variant of the crew module similar to progress ; however , this capability was removed in 2009
