no work took place immediately , but the stroudwater was eventually opened in 1779 , and within two years the shareholders commissioned a survey for a canal from dudbridge to cricklade , which would complete the link robert whitworth then surveyed two routes , the first as suggested by priddy , and the second direct from the severn to the thames following the valley of the river coln the estimated cost of the project was £127,916 , most of which was promised within three weeks the canal was to be suitable for boats wide , and so could accommodate thames barges , but not severn trows josiah clowes was appointed head engineer , surveyor and carpenter to the canal in 1783 to assist whitworth he left the construction of the canal shortly before completion to work on dudley tunnel an extra , shallow lock was built at boxwell , which allowed the level of the canal to be dropped beyond it , and more water to be taken from boxwell springs the new arrangements were adequate , although some of the reason was the failure of traffic to develop to the levels anticipated the wilts and berks canal was one , providing a link to the river at abingdon , but although it was proposed in 1793 , it was not opened until 1810 , and the north wilts canal , which provided a connecting link from latton to swindon was not completed until 1819 canal tolls were cut , in an attempt to retain traffic , but toll revenue fell from £11,000 to £2,874 between 1841 and 1855 the condition of the canal continued to decline they did so on 2 july 1901 among the organisations established that year was the stroudwater canal society , which soon became the stroudwater , thames and severn canal trust , and from 1975 , the cotswold canals trust two years later , county council support was required when the project benefited from 20 workers and a £17,000 budget for materials under the job creation scheme set up by the manpower services commission , as the council had to manage the scheme the estimated cost of the project was £82 million alongside these major developments , the trust has rebuilt a number of locks and bridges and some small sections of the rest of the route are now in water the restoration programme is divided into several key phases phase 3 completes the project , connecting brimscombe port in the west with gateway bridge in the east , via sapperton tunnel the final section of the canal before it joins the stroudwater navigation presents particular problems for restoration , as the channel had been used as part of a flood relief scheme by the environment agency at capels mill , the bed of the canal was used as the route for the stroud bypass in the 1980s , and so a diversion had to be built at this point as the project neared completion , open days to allow the public to walk along the bottom of the new canal section were held on 10 and 11 may 2013 , and were attended by over 1,800 people the new section was filled with water and officially completed on 2 june 2013 it travelled from the ocean at stonebridge eastwards to bowbridge lock , with a stop for lunch at upper wallbridge lock some work to prepare the brimscombe port site for development was funded by a £2 & nbsp ; million grant from the homes & communities agency given in october 2015 the second phase of the restoration programme covers the length of the stroudwater navigation between the ocean railway bridge , stonehouse , and saul junction on the gloucester and sharpness canal , a distance of about the simpler work includes construction of two new locks , restoration of a further six locks , construction of several minor road bridges , and reinstatement of about of in-filled canal most significantly , the original route has been divided by both the construction of the m5 motorway and development of the a38 trunk road in 2002 british waterways bought the lock at inglesham and the adjacent round house , to safeguard the route of the canal a staircase , built between the inner and outer wall , leads up to a circular bedroom on the second floor they were built in the 1790s for use by lock-keepers and lengthman , but were not particularly popular due to the limited amount of space and problems with finding suitable furniture for a circular room in 1953 , c forester published hornblower and the atropos , a historical novel set during the napoleonic wars , in which horatio hornblower , a captain in the royal navy , travels along the canal to london excerpt from '' hornblower and the atropos ''
