definitions , a dictionary of greek philosophical terms attributed to plato himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in the academy , provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia : '' the good composed of all goods ; an ability which suffices for living well ; perfection in respect of virtue ; resources sufficient for a living creature '' review of general psychology , vol aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of '' virtuous activity in accordance with reason '' 1097b22 & ndash ; 1098a20 ; even epicurus , who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure , maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue for a greek , areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics , for example , physical beauty the word happiness does not entirely capture the meaning of the greek word eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence , but quite independently of whether we do know about them ascribing eudaimonia to a person , then , may include ascribing such things as being virtuous , being loved and having good friends ross suggests 'well-being ' and john cooper proposes 'flourishing ' what we know of socrates ' philosophy is almost entirely derived from plato 's writings scholars typically divide plato 's works into three periods : the early , middle , and late periods ) wealth and political power aristotle 's account is articulated in the nicomachean ethics and the eudemian ethics since reason for aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well , he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character , which enables a person to exercise his practical reason ( i.e aristotle 's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue however , it is aristotle 's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia pyrrho was the founder of pyrrhonism a summary of his approach to eudaimonia was preserved by eusebius , quoting aristocles of messene , quoting timon of phlius , in what is known as the '' aristocles passage but if one says that a system is a way of life that , in accordance with appearances , follows a certain rationale , where that rationale shows how it is possible to seem to live rightly ( '' rightly '' being taken , not as referring only to aretē , but in a more ordinary sense ) and tends to produce the disposition to epoche , then we say that he does have a system '' this answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because its value lies in what one obtains by means of it – in this case , the money is a means to getting an apartment and a sports car and the value of making this money dependent on the price of these commodities one important difference between epicurus ' eudaimonism and that of plato and aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia , whereas epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness stoic philosophy begins with zeno of citium c.300 bc , and was developed by cleanthes ( 331 & ndash ; 232 bc ) and chrysippus ( c.280–c.206 bc ) into a formidable systematic unity zeno believed happiness was a '' good flow of life '' ; cleanthes suggested it was '' living in agreement with nature '' , and chrysippus believed it was '' living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature ) we saw earlier that the conventional greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by virtue , which has christian connotations of charity , patience , and uprightness , since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty the ritual process of declaring complete powerlessness and humility before god ) , charity and self-sacrificial love , though these behaviors/mentalities are not necessarily spurned by the stoics ( they are spurned by some other philosophers of antiquity ) one difference is that whereas the stoics regard external goods as neutral , as neither good nor bad , kant 's position seems to be that external goods are good , but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness theories include diener 's tripartite model of subjective well-being , ryff 's six-factor model of psychological well-being , keyes work on flourishing , and seligman 's contributions to positive psychology and his theories on authentic happiness and p.e.r.m.a ataraxia eudaemon ( mythology ) eudaemons eupraxsophy humanism maslow 's hierarchy of needs nicomachean ethics perfectionism phronesis social quality summum bonum virtue ethics well-being new york : the bobs-merrill company 1962 —— the complete works of aristotle , vol 1 and 2 ( rev ) , edited by jonathan barnes ( 1984 ) rackham , loeb classical library '' letter to menoeceus , principal doctrines , and vatican sayings 28–40 in hellenistic philosophy : introductory readings ( 2nd ed indianapolis : hackett publishing co anscombe ( 1981 ) , vol broadie , sarah w oxford : oxford university press sedley , the hellenistic philosophers , vol 1 and 2 ( cambridge : cambridge university press , 1987 ) darrin mcmahon ( 2005 ) happiness : a history ( 1991 ) socrates : ironist and moral philosopher ithaca , ny : cornell university press ancient ethical theory , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle 's ethics , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy aristotle : ethics , internet encyclopedia of philosophy
