in a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation , the primary heat source will be combustion of coal , oil , or natural gas in some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler ; biofuels such as bagasse , where economically available , can also be used where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process , a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam , with little or no extra fuel consumed ; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used however , ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiler water , and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the european '' pressure equipment directive '' for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors bs en 14222 : '' stainless steel shell boilers '' in live steam models , copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers in the 20th century , design practice moved towards the use of steel , with welded construction , which is stronger and cheaper , and can be fabricated more quickly and with less labour input output method ( direct method ) pet coke 8200 kcal/kg ) heat loss method ( indirect method ) to measure the boiler efficiency in indirect method , parameter like these are needed : ultimate analysis of fuel ( h 2 , s 2 , s , c , moisture constraint , ash constraint ) percentage of o 2 or co 2 at flue gas flue gas temperature at outlet ambient temperature in Â°c and humidity of air in kg/kg gcv of fuel in kcal/kg ash percentage in combustible fuel gcv of ash in kcal/kg boilers can be classified into the following configurations : pot boiler or haycock boiler/haystack boiler : a primitive '' kettle '' where a fire heats a partially filled water container from below in case of a locomotive-type boiler , a boiler barrel extends from the firebox and the hot gases pass through a bundle of fire tubes inside the barrel which greatly increases the heating surface compared to a single tube and further improves heat transfer fire-tube boilers may also be referred to as '' scotch-marine '' or '' marine '' type boilers rightwater-tube boiler : in this type , tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations this type generally gives high steam production rates , but less storage capacity than the above a flash boiler differs from the type of mono-tube steam generator in which the tube is permanently filled with water at worst , it can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life extremely large boilers providing hundreds of horsepower to operate factories can potentially demolish entire buildings draining of the boiler can also happen if a leak occurs in the steam supply lines that is larger than the make-up water supply could replace this is because unavoidable temperature and/or pressure loss that occurs as steam travels from the boiler to the machinery will cause some condensation , resulting in liquid water being carried into the machinery although superheating adds more energy to the steam in the form of heat there is no effect on pressure , which is determined by the rate at which steam is drawn from the boiler and the pressure settings of the safety valves however , the overall energy efficiency of the steam plant ( the combination of boiler , superheater , piping and machinery ) generally will be improved enough to more than offset the increased fuel consumption some are a combination of the two types navy destroyers built during world war ii operated at pressure and superheat hence designers endeavor to give the steam-handling components of the system as much strength as possible to maintain integrity boiler fittings and accessories pressuretrols to control the steam pressure in the boiler boilers generally have 2 or 3 pressuretrols : a manual-reset pressuretrol , which functions as a safety by setting the upper limit of steam pressure , the operating pressuretrol , which controls when the boiler fires to maintain pressure , and for boilers equipped with a modulating burner , a modulating pressuretrol which controls the amount of fire surface blowdown line : it provides a means for removing foam or other lightweight non-condensible substances that tend to float on top of the water inside the boiler feedwater check valve or clack valve : a non-return stop valve in the feedwater line natural draught through the use of a chimney is a type of induced draught ; mechanical draught can be induced , forced or balanced this method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys
