general topology grew out of a number of areas , most importantly the following : the detailed study of subsets of the real line ( once known as the topology of point sets ; this usage is now obsolete ) the introduction of the manifold concept the study of metric spaces , especially normed linear spaces , in the early days of functional analysis upper saddle river : prentice hall , 2000 adams , colin conrad , and robert david franzosa a subset of x may be open , closed , both ( clopen set ) , or neither basis for a topology a quotient space is defined as follows : if x is a topological space and y is a set , and if f : x→ y is a surjection function , then the quotient topology on y is the collection of subsets of y that have open inverse images under f a common example of a quotient topology is when an equivalence relation is defined on the topological space x discrete and trivial topologies cofinite and cocountable topologies any set can be given the cocountable topology , in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable on a finite-dimensional vector space this topology is the same for all norms such spaces are called finite topological spaces an extreme example : if a set is given the discrete topology , all functions : f\colon x \rightarrow t to any topological space are continuous the following criterion expresses continuity in terms of neighborhoods : f is continuous at some point x & nbsp ; ∈ & nbsp ; x if and only if for any neighborhood v of f ( x ) , there is a neighborhood u of x such that f ( u ) & nbsp ; ⊆ & nbsp ; v in many instances , this is accomplished by specifying when a point is the limit of a sequence , but for some spaces that are too large in some sense , one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a directed set , known as nets continuous functions preserve limits of nets , and in fact this property characterizes continuous functions the baire category theorem says : if x is a complete metric space or a locally compact hausdorff space , then the interior of every union of countable nowhere dense sets is empty sur les fonctions de variables réelles any open subspace of a baire space is itself a baire space main areas of research the topological characteristics of fractals in fractal geometry , of julia sets and the mandelbrot set arising in complex dynamics , and of attractors in differential equations are often critical to understanding these systems the name 'pointless topology ' is due to john von neumann garrett birkhoff , von neumann and lattice theory , john von neumann 1903-1957 , j pettis , american mathematical soc a unital associative topological algebra is a topological ring set-theoretic topology is a subject that combines set theory and general topology
