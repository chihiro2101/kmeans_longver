low frequency ground waves can be received up to from the transmitting antenna they identify themselves by a callsign in morse code they use long-wave , rather than shortwave or mediumwave , because long-wave signals from the transmitter to the receiver always travel along the same direct path across the surface of the earth , so the time delay correction for the signal travel time from the transmitting station to the receiver is always the same for any one receiving location may transmit on the newly-allocated 2200-meter band from 136â€“139 & nbsp ; khz at maximum equivalent power radiated from the antenna of 1 & nbsp ; watt ( eirp ) ; most nations in europe already have adopted the new band , along with many others worldwide in north america during the 1970s , the frequencies 167 , 179 , and 191 & nbsp ; khz were assigned to the short-lived public emergency radio of the united states the long-wave broadcasters are located in western , northern , central , and southeastern europe , the former soviet union , mongolia , algeria , and morocco this is because ground-wave propagation suffers less attenuation due to ground conductivity at lower frequencies ground-wave propagation curves for frequencies between 10 khz and 30 mhz long-wave carrier frequencies are exact multiples of 9 & nbsp ; khz ; ranging from 153 to 279 & nbsp ; khz , except for a french-language station , europe no
