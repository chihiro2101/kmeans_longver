the talmud notes that the hebrew numerical value ( gematria ) of the word torah is 611 , and combining moses 's 611 commandments with the first two of the ten commandments which were the only ones heard directly from god , adds up to 613 this reflects the concept that donning a garment with tzitzit reminds its wearer of all torah commandments rashi 's commentary on numbers 15:39 ( from numbers rabbah 18 ) ; compare to lekach tov , parshat shelach lecha , p.224 , s.v sifre deuteronomy 76 : אמר רבי שמעון בן עזיי והלא שלש מאות מצות עשה בתורה כיוצא בזה לומר מה הדם שאין בכל המצות קל ממנו הזהירך הכתוב עליו שאר כל המצות על אחת כמה וכמה also , even as the number gained acceptance , difficulties arose in elucidating the list and if we were to count only the root principles nahmanides , commentary to maimonides ' sefer hamitzvot , root principle 1 rabbi simeon ben zemah duran likewise rejected the dogma of the 613 as being the sum of the law , saying that '' perhaps the agreement that the number of mitzvot is 613 later codes of law such as the shulkhan arukh and kitzur shulkhan arukh do not refer to it ) sefer hamitzvot ( '' book of commandments '' ) by maimonides , with a commentary by nachmanides in this work , he supports his specification of each mitzvah through quotations from the midrash halakha and the gemara ) in addition to enumerating the commandments and giving a brief overview of relevant laws , the sefer ha-chinuch also tries to explain the philosophical reasons behind the mitzvot sefer ha-mitzvoth by rabbi yisrael meir kagan ( the '' chafetz chaim '' ) though the original work included only those commandments relevant in all places and at all times , later editions include agricultural laws relevant today only in the land of israel as the number of temple-only commandments appears to be much lower than 293 ( for example , sefer hahinuch only counted 201 such commandments ) , it seems that the overall count of commandments would likely be lower than 613
