psycholinguists study how people acquire and use language , according to the following main areas : language acquisition : how do children acquire language ? language comprehension : how do people comprehend language ? language production : how do people produce language ? second language acquisition : how do people who already know one language acquire another one ? a researcher interested in language comprehension may study word recognition during reading , to examine the processes involved in the extraction of orthography , morphological , phonological , and semantic information from patterns in printed text where syntax is concerned with the formal structure of sentences , semantics deals with the actual meaning of sentences in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition , psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors ( both in biology and psychology ) however , with the redefinition of innateness as time progressed , behaviors considered innate could once again be analyzed as behaviors that interacted with the psychological aspect of an individual . origin of '' psycholinguistics '' the theoretical framework for psycholinguistics began to be developed before the end of the 19th century as the '' psychology of language '' osgood and thomas a though there is still much debate , there are two primary theories on childhood language acquisition : the behaviorism perspective , whereby all language must be learned by the child ; and the innatist perspective , which believes that the abstract system of language can not be learned , but that humans possess an innate language faculty or an access to what has been called '' universal grammar '' skinner 's verbal behavior ( 1957 ) this view challenges the '' innate '' view as scientifically unfalsifiable ; that is to say , it can not be tested for example , one influential theory of sentence processing , the '' garden-path theory '' , states that syntactic analysis takes place first in this example , readers typically recognize their mistake by the time they reach '' by the lawyer '' and must go back and reevaluate the sentence in contrast to the modular view , an interactive theory of sentence processing , such as a constraint-based lexical approach assumes that all available information contained within a sentence can be processed at any time this can be seen in '' paris in thethe spring '' rayner , and a one of the most effective ways to explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of speech errors , which include speech disfluencies like false starts , repetition , reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences , as well as slips of the tongue , like-blendings , substitutions , exchanges ( e.g for example , they may be asked to make a judgment about a word ( lexical decision ) , reproduce the stimulus , or say a visually presented word aloud , catâ€“dog ) while others were unrelated ( e.g later , tanenhaus et al ( 1995 ) used a visual-world paradigm to study the cognitive processes related to spoken language newer , non-invasive techniques now include brain imaging by positron emission tomography ( pet ) ; functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) ; event-related potentials ( erps ) in electroencephalography ( eeg ) and magnetoencephalography ( meg ) ; and transcranial magnetic stimulation ( tms ) other examples of computational modelling are mcclelland and elman 's trace model of speech perception and franklin chang 's dual-path model of sentence production . areas for further research psycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the processes that the brain undergoes in order to comprehend and produce language using new non-invasive imaging techniques , recent research seeks to shed light on the areas of the brain involved in language processing
