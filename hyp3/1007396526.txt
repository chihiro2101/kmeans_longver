dawn begins with the first sight of lightness in the morning , and continues until the sun breaks the horizon this morning twilight before sunrise is divided into three categories depending on the amount of sunlight that is present in the sky , which is determined by the angular distance of the centre of the sun ( degrees below the horizon ) in the morning if the sky is clear , it is blue colored , and if there is some cloud or haze , there can be bronze , orange and yellow colours each stage of twilight ( civil , nautical , and astronomical ) lasts only 24 minutes this effect is more pronounced closer to the poles , where the sun rises at the vernal equinox and sets at the autumn equinox , with a long period of twilight , lasting for a few weeks in islam , astronomical dawn is called false morning ( subhe-kadhib , arabic صبح کاذب ) while nautical dawn is called sehr ( سحر ) or true morning ( subhe-sadiq , arabic صبح صادق ) and it is the time of first prayer of the day , and the beginning of the daily fast during ramadan many indo-european mythologies have a dawn goddess , separate from the male solar deity , her name deriving from pie hausos , derivations of which include greek eos , roman aurora and indian ushas ushas is one of the most prominent rigvedic deities the simple reading of the talmud is that dawn takes place 72 minutes before sunrise file : l'aurore by william-adolphe bouguereau - bma.jpg l'aurore by william-adolphe bouguereau file : guillaume vogels - l'aurore , mer du nord.jpg mer du nord by guillaume vogels : : : : : -dawn by paul laurence dunbar
