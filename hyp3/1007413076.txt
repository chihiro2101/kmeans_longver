victorian-gothic building seating just over 700 people , opened on 23 april 1879 , with a performance of much ado about nothing , a title which gave ammunition to several critics fire broke out , and the mass of half-timbered chosen to ornament the interior provided dry tinder addenbrooke ( 1974 ) on 14 january 1960 , hall 's first policy statement as director also proposed the acquisition of a second theatre , in london , to be used as a city outlet for selected stratford productions the critic michael billington , summarising these events , wrote : '' in 1960 the twenty-nine-year-old peter hall formally took charge at stratford-upon-avon and set about turning a star-laden , six-month shakespeare festival into a monumental , year-round operation built around a permanent company , a london base and contemporary work from home and abroad following a deal with prince littler , managing director of associated theatre properties , the rsc established the aldwych theatre as its london base for productions transferred from stratford to london , its stage redesigned to match the rst 's apron stage the production transferred to london , opening at the donmar warehouse in september 1977 before its further transfer to the larger young vic venue for a two-month season it was also recorded for transmission by thames television in 2004 , members of the rsc voted dench 's performance the greatest by an actress in the history of the company no other company in the world could match that output for quantity and quality '' the space was to be dedicated to playing the works of shakespeare 's contemporaries , the works of european writers and the occasional work of shakespeare nunn ( who had been appointed to follow hall 's tenure at the national theatre in 1968 ) ceded his rsc executive directorship in 1986 to his co-artistic director terry hands , who bore the brunt of media hostility during a difficult few years for the company to provide balance , simon trowbridge in a royal shakespeare company book , published in 2017 , is highly critical of aspects of the boyd years , including his decision to redevelop the royal shakespeare theatre as a second swan theatre in 2011 , bp began to subsidised the rsc 's £5 ticket scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds the same year , planning permission was granted by stratford district council to reinstate the other place funding was also received from the gatsby charitable foundation , the backstage trust , and from public donations ; this is the final phase of the transformation project in october 2019 , the rsc announced that it would be ending its partnership with bp at the end of year following criticism of its association with the oil company a spokesperson for the rsc explained that '' young people are now saying clearly to us that the bp sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the rsc' the rsc has three permanent theatres in stratford-upon-avon : the royal shakespeare theatre , a 1,060-seat theatre with thrust stage ( re-opened 24 november 2010 after transformation project ) the swan theatre , a smaller thrust stage , capacity 461 transformation : shakespeare 's
