in the introduction , sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness , being , and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists ( most notably husserl and heidegger ) as well as idealism , rationalism , and empiricism while being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being , being-for-itself is the being of consciousness in the first chapter , sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book , especially to his account for bad faith and freedom a concrete nothingness , e.g this totality is modified by the nothingness which is part of it '' for sartre , this is how nothingness can exist at all the relation between being-for-itself and being-in-itself is one of questioning the latter sartre , l'être et le néant , p 107-108 this essentially means that in being a waiter , grocer , etc new york : washington square press , 1984 , pp sartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith , one must realize that one 's existence and one 's formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control '' the good speaker is the one who plays at speaking because he can not be speaking part 3 , chapter 1 : the look the mere possible presence of another person causes one to gaze and see one 's world as it appears to the other the world is now the other person 's world , a foreign world that no longer comes from the self , but from the other the person is occupied and too busy for self-reflection this process is continual , unavoidable , and ineluctable the consequence is conflict this system is often mistakenly called '' love '' , but it is , in fact , nothing more than emotional alienation and denial of freedom through conflict with the other however , sartre contends our conscious choices ( leading to often unconscious actions ) run counter to our intellectual freedom though sartre 's conclusion seems to be that being diminishes before nothingness since consciousness is probably based more on spontaneity than on stable seriousness , he contends that any person of a serious nature is obliged to continuous struggle between two things : : a ) the conscious desire for peaceful self-fulfillment through physical actions and social roles—as if living within a portrait that one actively paints of oneself : b ) the more pure and raging spontaneity of no thing consciousness , of being instantaneously free to overturn one 's roles , pull up stakes , and strike out on new paths by '' self-consciousness '' , sartre does not mean being aware of oneself thought of as an object ( e.g barnes , 1984 , p toward the end of being and nothingness , sartre attempts to adapt some of freud 's ideas , and thereby develop an '' existential psychoanalysis '' in which causal categories are replaced by teleological categories . special terminology used by sartre being is objective , not subjective or individual who you are ( your essence ) is defined by what you do ( your existence ) it must forever choose for itself and therefore make itself reflection ( reflet ) : the form in which the for-itself founds its own nothingness through the dyad of '' the-reflection-reflecting '' reflection ( réflexion ) : the consciousness attempting to become its own object while marcel noted the influence of heidegger on '' the form at least '' of being and nothingness , he also observed that sartre diverged from the views expressed by heidegger in being and time ( 1927 ) in important ways , and that sartre 's contributions were original '' the philosopher william barrett described being and nothingness as '' a great , uneven , brilliant and verbose tome '' the literary scholar john b she maintained that continental philosophy shares the same general orientation as english analytic philosophy he wrote that sartre 's argument that freud 's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of freud , and that sartre 's attempts to adapt freud 's ideas are of greater interest the director richard eyre recalled that being and nothingness was popular among british students in the 1960s , but suggests that among them the work usually went unread several authors , including the sociologist murray s , davis , the philosophers roger scruton and maxine sheets-johnstone , and the physician frank gonzalez-crussi , have praised sartre for his contributions to the philosophy of sex scruton credited sartre with providing '' perhaps the most acute philosophical analysis '' of sexual desire and correctly arguing that treating sexual desire as equivalent to appetite ignores '' the interpersonal component of human sexual responses she praised his understanding of desire in general and suggested that his views about the subject anticipated those of the philosopher michel foucault
