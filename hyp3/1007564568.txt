lignin constitutes 30 % of non-fossil organic carbon and 20 to 35 % of the dry mass of wood the aryl substituent on these three monomers are sometimes called guaiacyl , syringyl , and 4-hydroxyphenyl from respectively coniferyl , sinapyl , and paracoumaryl alcohols it is hydrophobic as it is rich in aromatic subunits different types of lignin have been described depending on the means of isolation many grasses have mostly g , while some palms have mainly s lignin is present in all vascular plants , but not in bryophytes , supporting the idea that the original function of lignin was restricted to water transport in such mills , using the kraft or the sulfite process , lignin is removed from lignocellulose to yield pulp for papermaking much of this paper was delignified ; lignin comprises about 1/3 of the mass of lignocellulose , the precursor to paper given that it is the most prevalent biopolymer after cellulose , lignin has been investigated as a feedstock for biofuel production and can become a crucial plant extract in the development of a new class of biofuels lignin biosynthesis begins in the cytosol with the synthesis of glycosylated monolignols from the amino acid phenylalanine the oxidative enzyme catalyses the formation of monolignol radicals because it is cross-linked with the other cell wall components , lignin minimizes the accessibility of cellulose and hemicellulose to microbial enzymes , leading to a reduced digestibility of biomass some ligninolytic enzymes include haem peroxidase such as lignin peroxidases , manganese peroxidases , versatile peroxidases , and dye decolorizing peroxidase as well as copper-based laccases . lignin degradation by fungi some white rot fungi , such as c many fungal laccases are also secreted , which facilitate degradation of phenolic lignin-derived compounds , although several intracellular fungal laccases have also been described the ligninolytic activity of bacteria has not been studied extensively even though it was first described in 1930 in the environment , lignin can be degraded either biotically via bacteria or abiotically via photochemical alteration , and oftentimes the latter assists in the former acid-soluble lignin ( asl ) is quantified by the intensity of its ultraviolet spectroscopy a brilliant red color develops , owing to the presence of coniferaldehyde groups in the lignin thermochemolysis ( chemical break down of a substance under vacuum and at high temperature ) with tetramethylammonium hydroxide ( tmah ) or cupric oxide has also been used to characterize lignins non-woody and angiosperm vs
