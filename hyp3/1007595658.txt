amounting to 20 % of all car sales the model was offered through the 1973 model year in 1958 , the citroën id break ( known as the safari in english-speaking countries ) was introduced , being larger than other french station wagon models and of similar size to the contemporary full-size station wagons from the united states it had a seating capacity of eight people , consisting of two front-facing bench seats and two folding inward-facing seats in the cargo area the citroën id also had a two-part tailgate and hydropneumatic suspension , which allowed a self-leveling ride-height and automatic brake biasing regardless of the load carried the car could also 'kneel ' to the ground for easy loading of heavy or large items the successors to the id , the citroën cx and citroën xm continued to be amongst the largest station wagon cars produced in europe , but the model was discontinued in 2000 and a station wagon version was not available for its citroën c6 successor in a similar situation to the united states , the decline of traditional break and familiale models in france was in no small part due to the introduction of the minivan in the form of the renault espace in 1984 the duett two-door wagon was conceived as a dual-function delivery van and people-carrier , and is based on the chassis of the volvo pv444/544 sedans volvo continued production of station wagons through the volvo 145 ( introduced in 1967 ) , then the volvo 200 series ( introduced in 1974 ) and the volvo 700 series ( introduced in 1985 ) volvo station wagons produced since the mid-1990s are the volvo s40 , volvo v50 , volvo v60 , volvo v70 and volvo v90 , with the v40 , v60 and v90 models currently in production in 2005 a 'sportwagon ' version of the saab 9-3 was introduced , and produced until 2011 ford and holden produced wagon models based on each generation of their large sedan platforms until 2010 ford ceased production of wagons in australia when the ford falcon ( bf ) ended production in 2010 , largely due to the declining station wagon and large car market , but also following the 2004 introduction and sales success of the ford territory suv
