other related network tools were available both then and now despite the relatively slow computers and networks available at the time , accuracy of better than 100 milliseconds was usually obtained on atlantic spanning links , with accuracy of tens of milliseconds on ethernet networks it drew on the experimental results and clock filter algorithm documented in and was the first version to describe the client-server and peer-to-peer modes in 1991 , the ntpv1 architecture , protocol and algorithms were brought to the attention of a wider engineering community with the publication of an article by david l mills in the ieee transactions on communications the rfc included an analysis of all sources of error , from the master clock down to the final client , which enabled the calculation of a metric that helps choose the best server where several candidates appear to disagree the protocol has significantly moved on since then , and as of 2014 , an updated rfc has yet to be published ntp uses a hierarchical , semi-layered system of time sources a server synchronized to a stratum n server runs at stratum n + 1 rfc 5905 , p 21 ; stratum 1 : these are computers whose system time is synchronized to within a few microseconds of their attached stratum 0 devices ; stratum 3 : these are computers that are synchronized to stratum 2 servers windows 10 and windows server 2016 support 1 & nbsp ; ms time accuracy under certain operating conditions a portable version is available in linux package repositories ntpsec is a fork of the reference implementation that has been systematically security-hardened the first production release shipped in october 2017 chrony comes by default in red hat distributions and is available in the ubuntu repositories some implementation errors are basic , such as a missing return statement in a routine , that can lead to unlimited access to systems that are running some versions of ntp in the root daemon a 2017 security audit of three ntp implementations , conducted on behalf of the linux foundation 's core infrastructure initiative , suggested that both ntp ntp securitynotice page nvd nist product search ntp and ntpsec nvd nist product search ntpsec were more problematic than chrony nvd nist product search chrony from a security standpoint some of the services affected by fake ntp messages identified are tls , dnssec , various caching schemes ( such as dns cache ) , bgp , bitcoin and a number of persistent login schemes a small query is sent to an ntp server with the return address spoofed to be the target address
