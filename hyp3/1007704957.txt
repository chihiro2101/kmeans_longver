in 1942 , when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity , there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in sweden , ekerholm , helena bielefeld : transcript verlag , 2012 65,000 in france , 10,000 in denmark , and almost 8,000 in switzerland in 1944 , finland had 43,000 '' woodmobiles '' , of which 30,000 were buses and trucks , 7,000 private vehicles , 4,000 tractors and 600 boats this was quite popular during world war ii in several european , african and asian countries , because the war prevented easy and cost-effective access to oil in more recent times , wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries , or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine gasifiers have been built for remote asian communities using rice hulls , which in many cases have no other use combustion of wood gas generates no particulates , and the gas renders thus very little carbon black amongst motor oil . stoves , cooking and furnaces certain stove designs are , in effect , gasifiers working on the updraft principle : the air passes up through the fuel , which can be a column of rice hulls , and is combusted , then reduced to carbon monoxide by the residual char on the surface an alternative stove based on the down-draft principle and typically built with nested cylinders also provides high efficiency 5 to 6 kg of dry biomass yields 1 kg of hydrogen with minimum 60 % efficiency , the world war ii gasifiers , can be engineered to produce essentially tar-free gas ( less than 1 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 ) , while single-reactor fluidized bed gasifiers may exceed 50,000 & nbsp ; mg/m 3 tar presumably , these values can vary somewhat from sample to sample
