and a nation 's need to manufacture and repair its own navy and vessels that support its primary industries historically , the industry has suffered from the absence of global rules and a tendency towards ( state-subsidy ) over-investment due to the fact that shipyards offer a wide range of technologies , employ a significant number of workers , and generate income as the shipbuilding market is global modern shipbuilding manufacturing techniques entire multi-deck segments of the hull or superstructure will be built elsewhere in the yard , transported to the building dock or slipway , then lifted into place since roughly 1950 , specialized steels such as abs steels with good properties for ship construction have been used shipbuilding—extensive information about the u.s shipyard construction records shipyards united states—from globalsecurity.org shipbuilding news bataviawerf – the historic dutch east indiaman ship yard—shipyard of the historic ships batavia and zeven provincien in the netherlands , since 1985 here have been great ships reconstructed using old construction methods
