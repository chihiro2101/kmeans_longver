an early example of parliamentary government developed in today 's netherlands and belgium during the dutch revolt ( 1581 ) , when the sovereign , legislative and executive powers were taken over by the states general of the netherlands from the monarch , king philip ii of spain ; the first , in 1258 , stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second , in 1265 , included simon de montfort 's parliament the gradual democratisation of parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased parliament 's role in controlling government , and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government in the radicalised times at the end of world war i , democratic reforms were often seen as a means to counter popular revolutionary currents a bicameral parliament usually consists of a directly elected lower house with the power to determine the executive government , and an upper house which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house scholars of democracy such as arend lijphart distinguish two types of parliamentary democracies : the westminster and consensus systems the westminster system is usually found in the commonwealth of nations and countries which were influenced by the british political tradition these parliaments tend to have a more adversarial style of debate and the plenary session of parliament is more important than committees some western european countries ' parliaments ( e.g no parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government , but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a motion of no confidence , the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament , and thus has little or no influence in the decision examples : italy , thailand for example , in greece , if no party has a majority , the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an exploratory mandate to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days the head of state nominates a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment also , ireland where the president of ireland appoints the taoiseach on the nomination of the dáil éireann example : israel , 1996–2001 , where the prime minister was elected in a general election , with no regard to political affiliation , and whose procedure can also be described as of a semi-parliamentary system these requirements can still be circumvented norway is unique among parliamentary systems in that the storting always serves the whole of its four-year term parliamentarianism may also apply to regional and local governments a few parliamentary democratic nations such as india , pakistan , bangladesh etc parliamentary systems like that found in the united kingdom are widely considered to be more flexible , allowing rapid change in legislation and policy as long as there is a stable majority or coalition in parliament , allowing the government to have 'few legal limits on what it can do ' due to the first-past-the-post 'this system produces the classic '' westminster model '' with the twin virtues of strong but responsive party government' the united kingdom 's fused power system is often noted to be advantageous with regards to accountability bagehot considered the four-year election rule of the united states to be unnatural , as it can potentially allow a president who has disappointed the public with a dismal performance in the second year of his term to continue on until the end of his four-year term the nationalisation of services during the world wars , does have its drawbacks
