the lungs , liver , brain , and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors some patients , however , do not show any symptoms metastatic tumors are very common in the late stages of cancer olteanu g-e , mihai i-m , bojin f , gavriliuc o , paunescu v bosn j of basic med sci internet this specificity seems to be mediated by soluble signal molecules such as chemokines and transforming growth factor beta matteo parri , paola chiarugi endothelial progenitor cells incorporated in tumor vasculature suggests that this cell type in blood-vessel development is important in a tumor setting and metastasis these results suggested that pkc-Î¹ is involved in signaling pathways which upregulate emt in melanoma thereby directly stimulates metastasis lymphatic spread allows the transport of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes near the primary tumor and ultimately , to other parts of the body this lymph node is then called a sentinel lymph node the lymphatic system does eventually drain from the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct into the systemic venous system at the venous angle and into the brachiocephalic veins , and therefore these metastatic cells can also eventually spread through the haematogenous route however , often it remains unclear whether simultaneously diagnosed tumors of a canalicular system are one metastatic process or in fact independent tumors caused by the same agent ( field cancerization ) this was first discussed as the '' seed and soil '' theory by stephen paget in 1889 the propensity for a metastatic cell to spread to a particular organ is termed 'organotropism ' for example , prostate cancer usually metastasizes to the bones this hypothesis has been recently utilized to suggest several hypotheses about the life cycle of circulating tumor cells ( ctcs ) and to postulate that the patterns of spread could be better understood through a 'filter and flow ' perspective however , contemporary evidences indicate that the primary tumour may dictate organotropic metastases by inducing the formation of pre-metastatic niches at distant sites , where incoming metastatic cells may engraft and colonise when a second tumor is found in a patient that has been treated for cancer in the past , it is more often a metastasis than another primary tumor actin , myosin and mhc class ii down-regulation was also associated with the signature additionally , the metastatic-associated expression of these genes was also observed in some primary tumors , indicating that cells with the potential to metastasize could be identified concurrently with diagnosis of the primary tumor in aggressive cancer cells , loose dna fragments from unstable chromosomes spill in the cytosol leading to the chronic activation of innate immune pathways , which are hijacked by cancer cells to spread to distant organs additionally , the expression of these metastatic-associated genes was shown to apply to other cancer types in addition to adenocarcinoma h & e stain file : metstolungs.png metastatic cancer in the lungs file : metstobrain ( lungpri ) mark.png metastases from the lungs to the brain file : metstopancrease.png metastases from the lungs to the pancreas the skeleton was analyzed using radiography and a scanning electron microscope these findings were published in the public library of science journal
