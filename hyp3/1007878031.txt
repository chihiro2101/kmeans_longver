chemistry , physical properties and biological function in most arthropods , however , it is often modified , occurring largely as a component of composite materials , such as in sclerotin , a tanned proteinaceous matrix , which forms much of the exoskeleton of insects ( 1996 ) biology ( 4th edition ) benjamin cummings , new work in addition , some social wasps , such as protopolybia chartergoides , orally secrete material containing predominantly chitin to reinforce the outer nest envelopes , composed of paper dipartimento di biologia animale e genetica , universit√† di firenze nanofibrils have been made using chitin and chitosan . humans and other mammals humans and other mammals have chitinase and chi3l1 that can degrade chitin ; they also possess several immune receptors that can recognize chitin and its degradation products in a pathogen-associated molecular pattern , initiating an immune response chitin and chitosan are under development as scaffolds in studies of how tissue grows and how wounds heal , and in efforts to invent better bandages , surgical suture , and materials for allotransplantation scales from fish , exoskeletons from crustaceans and insects , etc ) could be put to use as feedstock for manufacturing processes
