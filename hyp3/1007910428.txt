the cipm also says that '' in order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose d and the dose equivalent h , the special names for the respective units should be used , that is , the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose d and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent h '' the sievert – quantity h - dose equivalent :1 & nbsp ; sv 1 & nbsp ; joule/kilogram – a biological effect the sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of a joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue icrp definition of the sievert '' the sievert is used for a number of dose quantities which are described in this article and are part of the international radiological protection system devised and defined by the icrp and icru when the sievert is used to represent the stochastic effects of external ionizing radiation on human tissue , the radiation doses received are measured in practice by radiometric instruments and dosimeters and are called operational quantities only the operational dose quantities which still use q for calculation retain the phrase dose equivalent however , there are joint icru/icrp proposals to simplify this system by changes to the operational dose definitions to harmonise with those of protection quantities measurement of h ( 10 ) and hp ( 10 ) in mixed high-energy electron and photon fields according to the icrp , the icru '' sphere phantom '' in most cases adequately approximates the human body as regards the scattering and attenuation of penetrating radiation fields under consideration icrp publication 103 , paragraph b64 as protection quantities can not practically be measured , operational quantities must be used to relate them to practical radiation instrument and dosimeter responses instrument and dosimetry response the radiation factor w r , which is specific for radiation type r – this is used in calculating the equivalent dose h t which can be for the whole body or for individual organs the calculation process is shown on the accompanying diagram this approach calculates the biological risk contribution to the whole body , taking into account complete or partial irradiation , and the radiation type or types
