his widowed mother , brother , two sisters and an aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house , struggling through the great depression under professor john c after his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his long-term career plans and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry he was initiated as a member of the zeta chapter of alpha chi sigma at the university of illinois in 1952 1,3-dithianes were pioneered by e.j the pka of dithianes is approximately 30 , allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent , typically n-butyllithium see the methods tab several reactions have been named after him : corey-itsuno reduction , also known as the corey-bakshi-shibata reduction , is an enantioselective reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a 6-membered ring transition state , leading to a four-membered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst the synthesis of dysidiolide by corey and co-workers was achieved via an enantioselective cbs reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex 1972 , 3769 the mechanism is similar to that of the wittig reaction by the formation of a phosphorus ylide with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrabromide the synthesis of natural products using the diels-alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of six-membered rings ( scheme 18 ) the reaction forms a sulfur ylide in situ that reacts with enones , ketones , aldehydes , and imines to form corresponding epoxides , cyclopropanes , and aziridines based on their reactivity , another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity corey and his research group have completed many total synthesis ; and schneider , w the published synthesis reveals a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride see publications in in 2002 , the american chemical society ( acs ) recognized him as the '' most cited author in chemistry '' corey and lászló kürti , enantioselective chemical synthesis : methods , logic , and practice , direct book publishing llc , 2010 , elias james corey , xue-min cheng the logic of chemical synthesis molecules and medicine john wiley & sons , 2008 altom cited in his 1998 farewell note '' abusive research supervisors '' as one reason for taking his life while altom was the second suicide in as many years in corey 's lab , corey was devastated and bewildered by his student 's death , the boston globe via archive.org ( 2001-01-02 ) i did my best every step of the way , '' corey states '' my conscience is clear we never had the slightest disagreement the author was stephen s as a result of altom 's death , the department of chemistry accepted a proposal allowing graduate students to ask two additional faculty members to play a small advisory role in preparing a thesis as of 2010 , approximately 700 people have been corey group members a database of 580 former members and their current affiliation was developed for corey 's 80th birthday in july , 2008 corey wrote : '' on may 4 , 1964 , i suggested to my colleague r woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed ( homo ) molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → 1,3-butadiene and 1,3,5-hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the woodward–hoffmann rules corey , impossible dreams tab this was corey 's first public statement on his claim that starting on may 5 , 1964 woodward put forth corey 's explanation as his own thought with no mention of corey and the conversation of may 4 corey has received more than 40 major awards including the linus pauling award ( 1973 ) , franklin medal ( 1978 ) , tetrahedron prize ( 1983 ) , wolf prize in chemistry ( 1986 ) , national medal of science ( 1988 ) , japan prize ( 1989 ) , nobel prize in chemistry ( 1990 ) , golden plate award of the academy of achievement ( 1991 ) , roger adams award ( 1993 ) , and the priestley medal ( 2004 ) as of 2008 , he has been awarded 19 honorary degrees from universities around the world including oxford university ( uk ) , cambridge university ( uk ) , and national chung cheng university corey , about e.j corey , honorary degrees tab in 2013 , the e.j compiled works of e.j corey elias james corey nobel lecture ( pdf ) podcast interview with e.j
