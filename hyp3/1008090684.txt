enhanced spectral range allows the viewer to take advantage of non-visible sources of electromagnetic radiation ( such as near-infrared or ultraviolet radiation ) all photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate eye contain molecules of photoreceptor protein which is a combination of the protein photopsin in cone cell , rhodopsin in rod cell , and retinal ( a small photoreceptor molecule ) 179 encyclopædia britannica , 1987 adaptation results in maximum sensitivity to light using red light for night vision is less effective for people with red–green color blindness , due to their insensitivity to red light many animals have a tissue layer called the tapetum lucidum in the back of the eye that reflects light back through the retina , increasing the amount of light available for it to capture , but reducing the sharpness of the focus of the image this is found in many nocturnal animals and some deep sea animals , and is the cause of eyeshine humans , and monkeys , lack a tapetum lucidum van de kraats and d rather than being scattered , the light is passed to each nucleus individually , by a strong lensing effect due to the nuclear inversion , passing out of the stack of nuclei , and into the stack of ten photorecepting rod cell the image intensifier is a vacuum-tube based device ( photomultiplier tube ) that can generate an image from a very small number of photons ( such as the light from stars in the sky ) so that a dimly lit scene can be viewed in real-time by the naked eye via visual output , or stored as data for later analysis active infrared night vision is now commonly found in commercial , residential and government security applications , where it enables effective night time imaging under low-light conditions this allows thermal infrared sensing in snakes , which functions by detecting thermal radiation before the introduction of image intensifiers , night glasses were the only method of night vision , and thus were widely utilized , especially at sea these systems are included in the latest avionics packages from manufacturers such as cirrus and cessna the us navy has begun procurement of a variant integrated into a helmet-mounted display , produced by elbit systems a specific type of nvd , the night vision goggle ( nvg ) is a night vision device with dual eyepieces to overcome this , soldiers were sometimes issued atropine eye drops to dilate pupils such systems typically use infrared cameras , sometimes combined with active illumination techniques , to collect information that is then displayed to the driver
