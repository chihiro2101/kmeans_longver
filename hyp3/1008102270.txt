'' in contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north america prior to world war ii , a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in russian beginning in 1942 , siemon william muller delved into the relevant russian literature held by the library of congress and the u.s geological survey library so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943 '' , year in which he coined the term as a contraction of permanently frozen ground office of the chief of engineers , strategic engineering study , no 62 , 1943 ) , occurrences on google books the middle zone is permanently frozen as “ permafrost ” , and the bottom layer is where the geothermal temperature is above freezing the extent of permafrost varies with the climate : in the northern hemisphere today , 24 % of the ice-free land area , equivalent to 19 & nbsp ; million square kilometers , is more or less influenced by permafrost a435 most of this area is found in siberia , northern canada , alaska and greenland beneath the active layer annual temperature swings of permafrost become smaller with depth exceptions occur in un-glaciated siberia and alaska where the present depth of permafrost is a relic of climatic conditions during glacial ages where winters were up to colder than those of today astakhov , 1986 ;
