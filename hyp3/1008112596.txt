glass fiber is formed when thin strands of silica-based or other formulation glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing he first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933 when the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber , they introduced continuous filament glass fibers other types of glass used are a-glass ( alkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide ) , e-cr-glass ( electrical/chemical resistance ; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1 % w/w alkali oxides , with high acid resistance ) , c-glass ( alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content , used for glass staple fibers and insulation ) , d-glass ( borosilicate glass , named for its low dielectric constant ) , r-glass ( alumino silicate glass without mgo and cao with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement ) , and s-glass ( alumino silicate glass without cao but with high mgo content with high tensile strength ) humidity is an important factor in the tensile strength hillermeier kh , melliand textilberichte 1/1969 , dortmund-mengede , pp during drawing , the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber , the viscosity must be relatively low in the direct melt process , the molten glass in the furnace goes directly to the bushing for formation the number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in multiples of 200 the attenuation ( drawing ) speed is important in the nozzle design the particular size applied relates to end-use usually these fibers are made into some sort of mat the air jets push it down vertically , and binder is applied although both glass fiber and asbestos are made from silica filaments , naima claims that asbestos is more dangerous because of its crystalline structure , which causes it to cleave into smaller , more dangerous pieces , citing the u.s department of health and human services : a 1998 study using rats found that the biopersistence of synthetic fibers after one year was 0.04â€“13 % , but 27 % for amosite asbestos the two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads lu , and aldo r boccaccini acs applied materials & interfaces 2018 10 ( 14 ) , 11529-11538 doi : 10.1021/acsami.8b01378 where the electric field orientation of short phosphate glass fibers can improve osteogenic qualities through the proliferation of osteoblasts and with improved surface chemistry , & dietz , a washington , dc : u.s as sodium based glass fibers assist or replace lithium in lithium-ion batteries due to its improved electronic properties new recycling effort aims to push kc to go green with its glass , kansas city star , october 14 , 2009 faqs about fiber glass insulation basalt fiber carbon fiber bs4994 composite materials fiberglass fiberglass molding filament tape gelcoat glass fiber reinforced concrete ( gfrc or grc ) glass microsphere glass poling glass wool optical fiber pele 's hair , naturally occurring glass fibre
