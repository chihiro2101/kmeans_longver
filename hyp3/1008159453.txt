the electrical properties of a cell are determined by the structure of the membrane that surrounds it a cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer of molecules in which larger protein molecules are embedded action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell all cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarized – in other words , they maintain a voltage difference across the cell 's plasma membrane , known as the membrane potential the shape of the action potential is stereotyped ; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell ( exceptions are discussed later in the article ) action potentials result from the presence in a cell 's membrane of special types of voltage-gated ion channels thus , in some situations , a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open , thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential an action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle ( hodgkin cycle ) proceeds explosively the most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction ( the '' v '' stands for '' voltage '' however , the likelihood of a channel 's transitioning from the inactivated state directly to the activated state is very low : a channel in the inactivated state is refractory until it has transitioned back to the deactivated state as the membrane potential is increased , sodium channel open , allowing the entry of sodium ions into the cell thus , the cell fires , producing an action potential being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance , the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics the first problem was solved by studying the giant axons found in the neurons of the squid ( loligo forbesii and doryteuthis pealeii , at the time classified as loligo pealeii ) since the current equals c times the rate of change of the transmembrane voltage v m , the solution was to design a circuit that kept v m fixed ( zero rate of change ) regardless of the currents flowing across the membrane for this discovery , they were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1991 tetrodotoxin from the pufferfish and saxitoxin from the gonyaulax ( the dinoflagellate genus responsible for '' red tides '' ) block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel ; similarly , dendrotoxin from the mamba snake inhibits the voltage-sensitive potassium channel the smaller cells labeled b are granule cells. alt hand drawn figure of two purkinje cells side by side with dendrites projecting upwards that look like tree branches and a few axons projected downwards that connect to a few granule cells at the bottom of the drawing in hermann von helmholtz and the foundations of nineteenth century science , ed david cahan , 50-108 berkeley ; los angeles ; london : university of california , 1994 for their discoveries , golgi and ramón y cajal were awarded the 1906 nobel prize in physiology image:3b8e.png thumb right ribbon diagram of the sodium–potassium pump in its e2-pi state the 20th century was a significant era for electrophysiology this line of research culminated in the five 1952 papers of hodgkin , katz and andrew huxley , in which they applied the voltage clamp technique to determine the dependence of the axonal membrane 's permeabilities to sodium and potassium ions on voltage and time , from which they were able to reconstruct the action potential quantitatively hodgkin and huxley correlated the properties of their mathematical model with discrete ion channels that could exist in several different states , including '' open '' , '' closed '' , and '' inactivated '' goldman to the eponymous goldman equation in 1943 mathematical and computational models are essential for understanding the action potential , and offer predictions that may be tested against experimental data , providing a stringent test of a theory the properties of the hodgkin–huxley and fitzhugh–nagumo models and their relatives , such as the bonhoeffer–van der pol model , have been well-studied within mathematics , sato , s ; fukai , h ; nomura , t ; doi , s in fitzhugh , r in computation nelson , me ; rinzel , j in rinzel , j & ermentrout , gb ; in and electronics getting , pa in
