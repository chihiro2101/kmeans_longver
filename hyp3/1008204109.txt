the acceptability of modern textual criticism as a tool for torah study is also debated this has led to women taking on more leadership roles this '' orthodoxy of convenience '' has maintained a certain stability over time : as long as these do n't seek to legitimize their behaviour in halakhic terms , the leadership of the ( modern ) orthodox world have no particular difficulty with them while hildesheimer 's role is not disputed—comprising distinct philosophy and pragmatic contributions—hirsch 's role is less clear , with some hirsch scholars arguing that his '' torah im derech eretz '' philosophy is in fact at odds with that of modern orthodoxy ; see further below and in the hildesheimer article torah im derech eretz hirsch 's torah im derech eretz – '' torah with the 'way of the world'/society '' ) is a philosophy of orthodox judaism that formalizes a relationship between halakhically observant judaism and the modern world in the synagogue and the kitchen , in the field and the warehouse , in the office and the pulpit with the pen and the chisel waxman , dilemmas of modern orthodoxy : sociological and philosophical and through which his influence is still felt he established jewish education for males and females , which included both religious and secular studies he established hildesheimer rabbinical seminary , one of the first orthodox yeshiva incorporating jewish studies , secular studies , and academic scholarship in its curriculum rabbi sol roth , the jewish idea of community the resultant mode of orthodox judaism is referred to as '' centrist orthodoxy '' soloveitchik ( 1903–1993 ) , rosh yeshiva at yeshiva university in rav soloveitchik 's thought , judaism , which believes that the world is '' very good '' , enjoins man to engage in tikkun olam : see also mizrachi ;
