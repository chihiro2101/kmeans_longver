rta specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the n-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 ( a4324 ) within the 28s rrna , but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the rna intact in particular , arg180 and glu177 have been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism , and not substrate binding , with enzyme kinetic studies involving rta mutants arg180 is positioned such that it can protonate n-3 of adenine and break the bond between n-9 of the adenine ring and c-1 ’ of the ribose ricin is very toxic if inhaled , injected , or ingested it acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis ricin is resistant , but not impervious , to digestion by protease by ingestion , the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract , where it may cause mucosal injuries when ingested , gastrointestinal symptoms can manifest within six hours ; these symptoms do not always become apparent another antidote developed by the us military has been shown to be safe and effective in lab mice injected with antibody-rich blood mixed with ricin , and has had some human testing while the oil cake from coconut , peanuts , and sometimes cotton seeds can be used as either cattle feed and/or fertilizer , the toxic nature of castor beans precludes their oil cake from being used as feed unless the ricin is first deactivated by autoclave if any of these native internalization sequences are present in a therapeutic agent , the drug will be internalized by , and kill , untargeted non-tumorous cells as well as targeted cancerous cells use of ricin as an adjuvant has potential implications for developing mucosal vaccines ricin is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the united states as defined in section 302 of the us emergency planning and community right-to-know act ( 42 u.s.c . chemical or biological warfare agent ; spektor , dalia m law at 32 stat 1903 ) , specifically annex §2 , ch.1 , article 23 , stating '' during world war ii the united states and canada undertook studying ricin in cluster bombs in spite of ricin 's extreme toxicity and utility as an agent of chemical/biological warfare , production of the toxin is difficult to limit only kilogram quantities of anthrax ) ricin is easy to produce , but is not as practical or likely to cause as many casualties as other agents licensed an anti-ricin vaccine called rivax from vitetta et al the prime suspects were the bulgarian secret police : georgi markov had defected from bulgaria some years previously and had subsequently written books and made radio broadcasts that were highly critical of the bulgarian communist regime after markov 's death the wound on kostov 's back was examined and a ricin-laced pellet identical to the one used against markov was removed for example , on 29 may 2013 two anonymous letters sent to new york city mayor michael bloomberg contained traces of it on 16 july 2014 , richardson was sentenced to 18 years in prison plus a restitution fine of 367,000 on 2 october 2018 , two letters suspected of containing ricin were sent to the pentagon ; one addressed to secretary of defense james mattis , and the other to chief of naval operations , admiral john richardson second , ondřej kolář , the mayor of prague 6 municipal district , who was involved in removing the controversial statue to the soviet-era marshal konev all of these three politicians had received police protection
