otherwise , it is prime for example , 5 x 20 and 20 x 5 consist of the same numbers this holds true for all n : all unique divisors of n are numbers less than or equal to , so we need not search past that this resulted in the pocklington primality test the first deterministic primality test significantly faster than the naive methods was the cyclotomy test ; its runtime can be proven to be o ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) c & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; log & nbsp ; n ) , where n is the number to test for primality and c is a constant independent of n many further improvements were made , but none could be proven to have polynomial running time subsequently , lenstra and pomerance presented a version of the test which runs in time õ ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 6 ) unconditionally agrawal , kayal and saxena suggest a variant of their algorithm which would run in õ ( ( log & nbsp ; n ) 3 ) if agrawal 's conjecture is true ; however , a heuristic argument by hendrik lenstra and carl pomerance suggests that it is probably false it is known that primes is not in ac0 these tests typically require factorization of n & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 1 , n − 1 , or a similar quantity , which means that they are not useful for general-purpose primality testing , but they are often quite powerful when the tested number n is known to have a special form
