one of the oldest fish hooks in the world , dated between 16,000 and 23,000 years old , was excavated at the jerimalai cave the later timorese were not seafarers , rather they were land focused people who rarely made contact with other islands early european explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century these portuguese were traders that arrived between 1512 and 1515 in 1702 the territory officially became a portuguese colony , known as portuguese timor , when lisbon sent its first governor , with lifau as its capital dominican friars , the occasional dutch raid , and the timorese themselves provided opposition to the portuguese at the beginning of the twentieth century , a faltering home economy prompted the portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies meanwhile , the dutch were colonising the rest of the island and the surrounding archipelago that is now indonesia the definitive border was drawn by the hague in 1914 , and it remains the international boundary between the modern states of east timor and indonesia although portugal was neutral during world war ii , in december 1941 , portuguese timor was occupied by australian and dutch forces , which were expecting a japanese invasion after the allied evacuation in february 1943 the east timorese continued fighting the japanese , with comparatively little collaboration with the enemy taking place very little investment was made in infrastructure , education and healthcare decolonisation , coup , and independence three main political parties were formed : the união democrática timorense ( udt , timorese democratic union ) , was supported by the traditional elites , initially argued for a continued association with lisbon , or as they put it in tetum , mate bandera hum — 'in the shadow of the portuguese flag ' , but later adopted a 'gradualist ' approach to independence the party committed itself to '' the universal doctrines of socialism '' suharto 's '' new order '' , which had effectively eliminated indonesia 's communist party pki in 1965 , was alarmed by what it saw as the increasingly left-leaning fretilin , and by the prospect of a small independent leftist state in the midst of the archipelago inspiring separatism in parts of the surrounding archipelago the coalition between fretilin and udt later broke up during the course of 1975 , portugal became increasingly detached from political developments in its colony , becoming embroiled in civil unrest and political crises , and more concerned with decolonisation in its african colonies of angola and mozambique than with portuguese timor on 11 august 1975 , the udt mounted a coup , in a bid to halt the increasing popularity of fretilin indonesia sought to portray the conflict as a civil war , which had plunged portuguese timor into chaos , but after only a month , aid and relief agencies from australia and elsewhere visited the territory , and reported that the situation was stable while fretilin had sought the return of the portuguese governor , pointedly flying the portuguese flag from government offices , the deteriorating situation meant that it had to make an appeal to the world for international support , independently of portugal on 28 november 1975 , fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence of the democratic republic of east timor ( república democrática de timor-leste in portuguese ) the movement was most extensive in neighbouring australia , in portugal , in the philippines and the former portuguese colonies in africa , but had significant force in the united states , canada and europe we understand the problem and the intentions you have a lot of rape were also taking place a detailed statistical report prepared for the commission for reception , truth and reconciliation in east timor cited a lower range of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974–1999 , namely , approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess ' deaths from hunger and illness on 31 may 1976 , a 'people 's assembly ' in dili , selected by indonesian intelligence , unanimously endorsed an 'act of integration ' , and on 17 july , east timor officially became the 27th province of the republic of indonesia ( timor timur ) we can refer to the resolution approved by the united nations general assembly on 12 december 1975 , saying '' having heard the statements of the representatives of portugal , as the administering power , concerning developments in portuguese timor.deplores the military intervention of the armed forces of indonesia in portuguese timor and calls upon the government of indonesia to withdraw without delay its armed forces from the territory.and recommends that the security council take urgent action to protect the territorial integrity of portuguese timor and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination '' with the event captured on film and aired around the world , the embarrassed indonesian government admitted to 19 killings , although it 's estimated that over 200 died in the massacre foreign powers such as the australian government , concerned to maintain good relations with indonesia , had been consistently reluctant to assist a push for independence ( despite popular sympathy for the east timorese cause among many in the australian electorate ) the dili massacre on 12 november 1991 was a turning point for sympathy for pro-independence east timorese etan.org , etan backgrounder for 20 may independence , east timor and indonesia action network retrieved on 16 august
