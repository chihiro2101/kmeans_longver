at the time , 1 megabyte was considered a relatively large amount of memory , so the designers of the ibm personal computer reserved the first 640 kilobytes for use by applications and the operating system and upper memory area for the bios ( basic input/output system ) and memory for peripheral this enabled 24 bit addressing which allowed the processor to access 2 24 bytes of memory , equivalent to 16 megabytes . 386 additions to protected mode until the release of the 386 , protected mode did not offer a direct method to switch back into real mode once protected mode was entered ; set pe bit mov eax , cr0 or eax , 1 mov cr0 , eax ; far jump ( cs selector of code segment ) jmp cs : pm pm : ; now we are in pm with the release of the 386 , protected mode could be exited by loading the segment registers with real mode values , disabling the a20 line and clearing the pe bit in the cr0 register , without the need to perform the initial setup steps required with the 286 according to the intel 80286 programmer 's reference manual , for the most part , the binary compatibility with real-mode code , the ability to access up to 16 mb of physical memory , and 1 gb of virtual memory , were the most apparent changes to application programmers this was not without its limitations despite such potential setbacks , windows 3.0 and its successors can take advantage of the binary compatibility with real mode to run many windows 2.x ( windows 2.0 and windows 2.1x ) applications in protected mode , which ran in real mode in windows 2.x programs that require segment manipulation , privileged instructions , direct hardware access , or use self-modifying code will generate an exception that must be served by the operating system the segment address inside the descriptor table entry is expanded to 32 bits so every byte of the physical memory can be defined as bound of the segment the limit value inside the descriptor table entry is expanded to 20 bits and completed with a granularity flag ( g-bit , for short ) : if g-bit is zero limit has a granularity of 1 byte , i.e segment size may be 1 , 2 , , 2 20 Ã— 2 12 bytes if paging is off , the calculated linear address equals the physical memory address where : a is the accessed bit ; r is the readable bit ; c ( bit 42 ) depends on x : if x 1 then c is the conforming bit , and determines which privilege levels can far-jump to this segment ( without changing privilege level ) : if c 0 then only code with the same privilege level as dpl may jump here ; if c 1 then code with the same or a lower privilege level relative to dpl may jump here x is the executable bit : if x 1 then the segment is a code segment ; if x 0 then the segment is a data segment s is the segment type bit , which should generally be cleared for system segments ; dpl is the descriptor privilege level ; p is the present bit ; d is the default operand size ; g is the granularity bit ; bit 52 of the 80386 descriptor is not used by the hardware originally , a page directory was the size of one page , four kilobytes , and contained 1,024 page directory entries ( pde ) , although subsequent enhancements to the x86 architecture have added the ability to use larger page sizes this is commonly due to portability concerns or due to the performance issues created with hardware task switches windows & nbsp ; 3.0 was able to run real mode programs in 16-bit protected mode ; when switching to protected mode , it decided to preserve the single privilege level model that was used in real mode , which is why windows applications and dlls can hook interrupts and do direct hardware access that lasted through the windows 9x series for changing the screen-resolution using bios functionality ) in os/2 2.0 ( and later os/2 ) and 32-bit windows nt , all under control of a 32-bit kernel
