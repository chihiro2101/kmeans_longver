it may be described as 'coarse ' or 'fine ' depending on its amplitude , or as progressing from coarse to fine v-fib some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine v-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life , whereas others will deliver cpr and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation it is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation automaticity is a measure of the propensity of a fiber to initiate an impulse spontaneously the product of a hypoxic myocardium can be hyperirritable myocardial cells the ionic basic automaticity is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during diastole in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to –50 to –60 & nbsp ; mv ho k 1993 when myocardial cell are exposed to hyperkalemia , the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized as a result of the alteration of ik1 potassium current , whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations the role of re-entry or circus motion was demonstrated separately by g mines gr 1913 , garrey we 1914 mines created a ring of excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the ray fish in practice , this may be an area of ischemic or infarcted myocardium , or underlying scar tissue in clinical practice , therefore , factors that would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through hypertrophy or dilatation , drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease all afterdepolarisations may not reach threshold potential , but , if they do , they can trigger another afterdepolarisation , and thus self-perpetuate people who survive a '' v-fib arrest '' and who make a good recovery are often considered for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator , which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment myerburg rj et al lyman brewer suggests that the first recorded account of ventricular fibrillation dates as far back as 1500 bc , and can be found in the ebers papyrus of ancient egypt '' a book authored by jo miles suggests that it may even go back farther subsequent to this in 1850 , fibrillation was described by ludwig and hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a '' faradic '' ( electrical ) current to the heart hoffa m et al vulpian a 1874 john a this definition still holds today , and is interesting in the fact that his studies and description predate the use of electrocardiography hoffman a 1912 at this time , two other researchers , george ralph mines and garrey , working separately , produced work demonstrating the phenomenon of circus movement and re-entry as possible substrates for the generation of arrhythmias bender in 1922 , who produced an electrocardiogram showing ventricular tachycardia evolving into ventricular fibrillation 1922 the re-entry mechanism was also advocated by deboer , who showed that ventricular fibrillation could be induced in late systole with a single shock to a frog heart
