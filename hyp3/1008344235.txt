phloem is a nutrient-conducting tissue composed of sieve tubes or sieve cells mixed with parenchyma and fibers often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants , which is composed of cork ( phellem ) , the cork cambium ( phellogen ) , and the phelloderm the skin on the potato tuber ( which is an underground stem ) constitutes the cork of the periderm as the stem grows , the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm , namely the epidermis , cortex and older secondary phloem die the rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark , being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees cork can contain antiseptics like tannins , that protect against fungal and bacterial attacks that would cause decay the bark canoes and skin boats of north america washington : smithsonian institution and aspirin ( from the bark of willow trees ) bark is important to the horticultural industry since in shredded form it is used for plants that do not thrive in ordinary soil , such as epiphytes wood bark contains lignin ; when it is pyrolyzed ( subjected to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen ) , it yields a liquid bio-oil product rich in natural phenol derivatives cut logs are inflamed either just before cutting or before curing dordrecht : kluwer academic publishers fungi and other plants like mosses , algae and other vascular plants file : bark nunniong.jpg eucalypt bark file : close-up of living bark on a tree in england.jpg close-up of living bark on a tree in england file : acer capillipes ( snakebark maple ) file : burr on oak at kilbirnie.jpg quercus robur bark with a large burl and lichen london , frances lincoln , 2010 ( translated by susan berry )
