a dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations the point is also a limit set , as trajectories converge to it ; the point is not a limit set \ an attractor is a subset a of the phase space characterized by the following three conditions : a is forward invariant under f : if a is an element of a then so is f ( t , a ) , for all & nbsp ; t & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; 0 in the case of r n , the euclidean norm is typically used more complex attractors that can not be categorized as simple geometric subsets , such as topology wild sets , were known of at the time but were thought to be fragile anomalies intersection and union ) of geometric primitive ( e.g lines , surfaces , spheres , toroids , manifolds ) , then the attractor is called a strange attractor if we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations , then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation in the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl , even if the bowl seems perfectly hemispherical , and the marble 's sphere shape , are both much more complex surfaces when examined under a microscope , and their shapes change or deform during contact there are many points in this surface terrain ( and the dynamic system of a similarly rough marble rolling around on this microscopic terrain ) that are considered stationary or fixed points , some of which are categorized as attractors this is illustrated by the logistic map , which depending on its specific parameter value can have an attractor consisting of 1 point , 2 points , 2 n points , 3 points , 3×2 n points , 4 points , 5 points , or any given positive integer number of points such a time series does not have a strict periodicity , but its power spectrum still consists only of sharp lines strange attractors may also be found in the presence of noise , where they may be shown to support invariant random probability measures of sinai–ruelle–bowen type examples of strange attractors include the double scroll attractor , hénon map , rössler attractor , and lorenz attractor if the expression has more than one real root , some starting points for the iterative algorithm will lead to one of the roots asymptotically , and other starting points will lead to another the basins of attraction can be infinite in number and arbitrarily small for the function f ( x ) x^3-2x^2-11x+12 , the following initial conditions are in successive basins of attraction : :2.35287527 converges to 4 ; :2.35284172 converges to −3 ; :2.35283735 converges to 4 ; :2.352836327 converges to −3 ; :2.352836323 converges to 1 as can be seen , the combined basin of attraction for a particular root can have many disconnected regions for the three-dimensional , incompressible navier–stokes equation with periodic boundary conditions , if it has a global attractor , then this attractor will be of finite dimensions in his work on cellular automata , stephen wolfram classified four classes which , for any given rule and initial condition , the system ’ s long term behavior can be said to belong to while continuous systems like a pendulum may get exponentially close to an attractor , cellular automata can reach attractors in finite time this can be thought of as analogous to the non-integrability of systems which generate strange attractors , most notably the lorenz system see the talk page for more information
