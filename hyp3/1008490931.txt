the division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly , and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself it has been identified that non-coding rnas ( e.g this also justifies the non-coding rnas ' contribution in various cartilage-dependent pathological conditions such as arthritis , and so on the ecm consists mainly of proteoglycan and collagens due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension , the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body several diseases can affect cartilage traumatic rupture or detachment : the cartilage in the knee is frequently damaged but can be partially repaired through knee cartilage replacement therapy spinal disc herniation : asymmetrical compression of an intervertebral disc ruptures the sac-like disc , causing a herniation of its soft content tumors arising from other tissues may also produce a cartilage-like matrix , the best-known being pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary glands other type of cartilage found in limulus polyphemus is the endosternite cartilage , a fibrous-hyaline cartilage with chondrocytes of typical morphology in a fibrous component , much more fibrous than vertebrate hyaline cartilage , with mucopolysaccharides immunoreactive against chondroitin sulfate antibodies there are homologous tissues to the endosternite cartilage in other arthropods the endosternite cartilage forms close to hh-expressing ventral nerve cords and expresses cola and soxe , a sox9 analog the cartilage growth pattern is the same as in vertebrate cartilage the odontophore contains muscle cells along with the chondrocytes in the case of lymnaea and other mollusks that graze vegetation these regions are an acellular fibrous region with a high collagen content , called cartilage-like matrix , and collagen lacking a highly cellularized core , called osteoid-like matrix university of sydney ( 2010-06-16 )
