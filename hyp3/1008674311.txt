however , it arrives there at a different ( later ) time each event can be labeled by four numbers : a time coordinate and three space coordinates ; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space as expressed by f.r harvey : a curve m in spacetime is called a worldline of a particle if its tangent is future timelike at each point a one-dimensional line or curve can be represented by the coordinates as a function of one parameter a metric exists and its dynamics are determined by the einstein field equations and are dependent on the mass-energy distribution in spacetime any timelike curve admits a proper frame whose '' time axis '' corresponds to that curve , and , since no observer is privileged , we can always find a local coordinate system in which lightcones are inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis quantum field theory , the framework in which all of modern particle physics is described , is usually described as a theory of quantized fields however , although not widely appreciated , it has been known since feynman that many quantum field theories may equivalently be described in terms of world lines fields at the university of toronto in the early days of relativity it was advertised to be a '' mathematical fantasy '' â€”and it was ! the substance of the exercise was as follows : he postulated that , commencing with his birth , every human being had some kind of spiritual aura with a long filament or thread attached , that traveled behind him throughout his life author oliver franklin published a science fiction work in 2008 entitled world lines in which he related a simplified explanation of the hypothesis for laymen you are not quite six feet tall , you are about twenty inches wide and perhaps ten inches thick world lines and other physical concepts like the dirac sea are also used throughout the series world lines article on h2g2
