nearly 5 billion of the world 's population of 7 billion as of 2010 still hand-wash their clothes jacob christian schäffer 's washing machine design was published 1767 in germany in 1782 , henry sidgier issued a british patent for a rotating drum washer , and in the 1790s edward beetham sold numerous '' patent washing mills '' in england while the technology was simple enough , it was a milestone in the history of washing machines , as it introduced the idea of '' powered '' washing drums 28 during the 1850s , nicholas bennett from the mount lebanon shaker society at new lebanon , new york , invented a '' wash mill '' , but in 1858 he assigned the patent to david parker of the canterbury shaker village , where it was registered as the '' improved washing machine '' front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine top loaders may require less periodic maintenance , since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows , although a plastic tub may still require a periodic '' maintenance wash '' cycle ( described below ) as with front-loading washers , clothing should not be packed tightly into a top-loading washer some top-loading machines use mechanisms very similar to front-loading drum machines , and are described below this access door is locked shut with an interlock during the entire wash cycle , since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor in most machines , the interlock is usually doubly redundant to prevent either opening with the drum full of water or being opened during the spin cycle the drum bearing eventually wears out , and usually requires extensive dismantling of the machine to replace , which often results in the machine being write-off due to the failure of a relatively inexpensive component that is labor-intensive to renew extreme overloading of front-loading washers pushes fabrics towards the small gap between the loading door and the front of the wash basket , potentially resulting in fabrics lost between the basket and outer tub , and in severe cases , tearing of clothing and jamming the motion of the basket variant and hybrid designs there are also combo washer dryer machines that combine washing cycles and a full drying cycle in the same drum , eliminating the need to transfer wet clothes from a washer to a dryer machine some implementations are patented under us patent us6343492b1 and us patent us 6363756b1 they usually take somewhat longer ( 20–110 minutes ) to wash a load , but are often computer controlled with additional sensors , to adapt the wash cycle to the needs of each load estimates are that front-loaders use from one third to one half as much water as top-loaders high-efficiency top-loaders with a wash plate ( instead of an agitator ) can spin up to 1100 rpm , as their center of gravity is lower difficult items : top-loaders may have trouble cleaning large items , such as sleeping bags or pillows , which tend to float on top of the wash water rather than circulate within it compactness : true front-loading machines may be installed underneath counter-height work surfaces water leakage : top-loading machines are less prone to leakage , because simple gravity can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top during the spin cycle , a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine , using only a lip around the top of the inner basket and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge on the other hand , top-loaders use mechanical gearboxes that are more vulnerable to wear than simpler front-load motor drives initial cost : in countries where top-loaders are popular , front-loaders tend to be more expensive to buy than top-loaders , though their lower operating costs can ultimately lead to lower total cost of ownership , especially if energy , detergent , or water are expensive in addition , manufacturers have tended to include more advanced features such as internal water heating , automatic dirt sensors , and high-speed emptying on front-loaders , although some of these features could be implemented on top-loaders washing machines with internal heaters can use special detergents formulated to release different chemical ingredients at different temperatures , allowing different type of stains and soils to be cleaned from the clothes as the wash water is heated up by the electrical heater temperatures exceeding have the undesirable effect of inactivating the enzymes when using biological detergent front loaders need to use low-sudsing detergents because the tumbling action of the drum folds air into the clothes load that can cause over-sudsing and overflows however , due to efficient use of water and detergent , the sudsing issue with front-loaders can be controlled by simply using less detergent , without lessening cleaning action bosch for example , in its allergy wash program , incorporates an additional 3-minute rinse cycle with water of at least 60 degree celsius to rinse off detergent residues and any allergen if a heated clothes dryer is used after the wash and spin , energy use is reduced if more water has been removed from clothes washing machines display an eu energy label with grades for energy efficiency , washing performance and spin efficiency there are two reasons for that energy consumption for clothes washers is quantified using the energy factor but after new mandatory federal standards were introduced , many us washers were manufactured to be more energy- and water-efficient than required by the federal standard , or even certified by the more stringent energy star standard certified energy star units can be compared by their modified energy factor ( mef ) and water factor ( wf ) coefficients energy star washers have also a wf of less than 6.0 ( the lower the better ) by contrast , commercial washers for internal business operations ( still often referred to as '' washer/extractor '' machines ) may include features absent from domestic machines noise and vibration is not as unacceptable as in a domestic machine the historically laborious process of washing clothes ( wikt : laundry day ) has at times been labelled 'woman 's work ' the following year , swedish statistician hans rosling suggested that the positive effect the washing machine had on the liberation of women , makes it '' the greatest invention of the industrial revolution '' revista veja , issue 2,363 , 5 march 2014 ( in portuguese ) as a communal activity became a solitary one the energy required for heating is large compared to that used by lighting ,
