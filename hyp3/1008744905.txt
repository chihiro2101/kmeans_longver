in 1886 , adolf mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants , similar to bacterial infections translated into english in johnson , j ( 1942 ) phytopathological classics ( st paul , minnesota : american phytopathological society ) no however , ivanovsky remained rather convinced , despite repeated failures to produce evidence , that the causal agent was an unculturable bacterium , too small to be retained on the employed chamberland filters and to be detected in the light microscope in 1955 , heinz fraenkel-conrat and robley williams showed that purified tmv rna and its capsid ( coat ) protein assemble by themselves to functional viruses , indicating that this is the most stable structure ( the one with the lowest free energy ) map at 3.6 å resolution on a dried leaf , it can withstand up to 50 & nbsp ; °c ( 120 degree fahrenheit ) for 30 minutes tmv has an index of refraction of about 1.57 tmv most likely moves from cell-to-cell as a complex of the rna , p30 , and replicate proteins moreover , tmv can be transmitted from one plant to another by direct contact after the coat protein and rna genome of tmv have been synthesized , they spontaneously assemble into complete tmv virions in a highly organized process there are many different strains the first symptom of this virus disease is a light green coloration between the veins of young leaves rugosity may also be seen where the infected plant leaves display small localized random wrinkles it has a very wide survival range sinensis suffered almost no lesioning in vitro from tmv when treated with a p
