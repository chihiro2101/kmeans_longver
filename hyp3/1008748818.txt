the practice was later reported by ling biao lu yi ( late tang dynasty or early five dynasties ) , in ji le pian by zhuang jisu ( song dynasty ) , in the book of tree planting by yu zhen mu ( ming dynasty ) , in the book guangdong xing yu ( 17th century ) , lingnan by wu zhen fang ( qing dynasty ) , in nanyue miscellanies by li diao yuan , and others riley and the illinois state entomologist w 110 years of biological control research and development in the united states department of agriculture : 1883–1993 pages 3–11 in 1905 the usda initiated its first large-scale biological control program , sending entomologists to europe and japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth , lymantria dispar dispar , and brown-tail moth , brown-tail , invasive pests of trees and shrubs digging , burning , and crushing all proved ineffective the first reported case of a classical biological control attempt in canada involves the parasitoidal wasp trichogramma minutum individuals were caught in new york state and released in ontario gardens in 1882 by william saunders , a trained chemist and first director of the dominion experimental farms , for controlling the invasive currantworm nematus ribesii to be most effective at controlling a pest , a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time damage from hypera postica , the alfalfa weevil , a serious introduced pest of forage , was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies ) by introducing agasicles hygrophila it takes root in shallow water , interfering with navigation , irrigation , and flood control careful formulations of the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis are more effective in inoculative release , small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce , in the hope of setting up longer-term control and thus keeping the pest down to a low level , constituting prevention rather than cure recommended release rates for trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre ( 1 to 50 per square metre ) per week according to the level of pest infestation natural enemies are already adapted to the habitat and to the target pest , and their conservation can be simple and cost-effective , as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields providing a suitable habitat , such as a windbreak , hedgerow , or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce , can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside in cotton production , the replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the bt protein predators are mainly free-living species that directly consume a large number of prey during their whole lifetime ladybugs , and in particular their larvae which are active between may and july in the northern hemisphere , are voracious predators of aphids , and also consume mites , scale insects and small caterpillars the larvae of many hoverfly species principally feed upon aphids , one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime the running crab spider philodromus cespitum also prey heavily on aphids , and act as a biological control agent in european fruit orchards michalko , radek ; dvoryankina , viktoriya ( 1 june 2019 ) agriculture , ecosystems & environment species used to control spider mites include the predatory mites phytoseiulus persimilis , neoseilus californicus , and amblyseius cucumeris , the predatory midge feltiella acarisuga , and a ladybird stethorus punctillum for rodent pests , cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of refuge ( ecology ) locations although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose , they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats ; they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes encouraging innovation in biopesticide development thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops , making the plants express some of the bacterium 's toxins , which are proteins entomopathogenic fungi , which cause disease in insects , include at least 14 species that attack aphids are deployed against white flies , thrips and aphids paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies , thrips and aphids ; purpureocillium lilacinus is used against root-knot nematodes , and 89 trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens very young animals survived , passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population initial results for tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise , and it is now being released along with beauveria bassiana , a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties however , there has been some recent evidence that native predators are adapting , both physiologically and through changing their behaviour , so in the long run , their populations may recover however , the weevil also attacks native thistles , harming such species as the endemic platte thistle ( cirsium neomexicanum ) by selecting larger plants ( which reduced the gene pool ) , reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species ' survival this introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action the sturdy and prolific eastern mosquitofish ( gambusia holbrooki ) is a native of the southeastern united states and was introduced around the world in the 1930s and '40s to feed on mosquito larvae and thus combat malaria those females that copulate with the sterile males will lay infertile eggs , resulting in a decrease in the size of the population midwest institute for biological control , illinois . effects on native biodiversity csiro australian animal health laboratory biological control of the cane toad bufo marinus in australia johnson , m association of natural biocontrol producers international organization for biological control
