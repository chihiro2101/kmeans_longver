marx 's family was jewish as with all of the marx brothers , different theories exist as to where zeppo got his stage name : groucho said in his carnegie hall concert in 1972 that the name was derived from the zeppelin airship zeppo 's ex-wife barbara sinatra repeated this in her 2011 book , lady blue eyes : my life with frank in lady blue eyes , barbara sinatra , zeppo 's second wife , reported that zeppo was considered too young to perform with his brothers , and when gummo joined the army , zeppo was asked to join the act as a last-minute stand-in at a show in texas while groucho , harpo , and chico are hogging the show , as the phrase has it , their brother hides in an insignificant role , peeping out now and then to listen to plaudits in which he has no share groucho later said of his brother : '' except for the chorus girls , being a straight man in the marx brothers was n't fun for him zeppo had great mechanical skills and was largely responsible for keeping the marx family car running of inglewood , california , later acquired by the aeroquip company '' international directory of company histories , edited by tina grant , vol james press , 1997 , pp 3,473,526 ; '' cardiac pulse-rate monitor '' , filed july 14 , 1967 & issued october 21 , 1969 ; 3,426,747 , '' method and watch mechanism for actuation by a cardiac pulse '' , a continuation-in-part filed november 20 , 1967 , issued february 11 , 1969 and a therapeutic pad for delivering moist heat to a patient us pto ; u.s on april 12 , 1927 , zeppo married marion benda ( birth name bimberg ) blakeley also wrote in her book that zeppo wanted to keep her son out of the picture , adding a room for him onto his estate , which was more of a guest house , as it was separated from the main residence it was also decided that blakeley 's son would go to military school , which according to blakeley , pleased zeppo the press eventually got wind of the affair , snapping photos of blakely and sinatra together , or asking blakeley questions whenever they spotted her both she and sinatra denied the affair zeppo and blakeley divorced in 1973 blakeley and sinatra continued to date , and were constantly hounded by the press until the divorce between zeppo and blakeley became final the doctors thought the cancer had gone into remission , but it returned he was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the pacific ocean both sinatra and blakeley attended his funeral while this interpretation of zeppo 's comedic contributions could seemingly be considered a contemporary reappraisal of his role in the paramount pictures , more astute film reviewers were apparently in on the joke as far back as the release of i 'll say she is , the team 's 1924 broadway hit in its review of the play , the new york daily news calls zeppo '' the obliging audience of the family – the feeder who helps his brothers be funny by playing straight himself when the new york times reviewed their debut film the cocoanuts in 1929 , it ranked all four marx brothers equally – '' when the four marx brothers are on the screen , it 's a riot '' emphasis added – and went on to describe each of the brothers ' unique style of comedy , and praised zeppo as '' the handsome but dogged straight man with the charisma of an enamel washstand in his essay '' the marx brothers : from vaudeville to hollywood , '' roger s bader , robert s chandler 's appraisal of zeppo 's role in the films – as an interpreter for his older brothers to the audience – was essentially confirmed by groucho himself , who once noted that zeppo 's role was '' handsome , obtuse , slightly wooden , '' and that he '' brought logic to a basically illogical story , '' acting as '' an intrusion '' to their otherwise complete anarchy zeppo 's comic persona was further highlighted in the '' dictation scene '' of animal crackers and only zeppo could even try such a thing as taking down the heading and the salutation and leaving out the letter because it did n't sound important to him it has taken forty years , of course , for the full humor to come across ellis wrote in his article '' yes , sir : the legacy of zeppo marx '' : indeed , zeppo is a link between the audience and groucho , harpo and chico he knows who those guys are and what they are capable of the humor is in his incongruity cary grant : the biography the johns hopkins university press ( september 1 , 1992 ) the new yorker , june 1 , 2016
