the other type , invented by richard f cherry of the xerox microelectronics center williams and robert s modern surface-independent optical mice work by using an optoelectronic sensor ( essentially , a tiny low-resolution video camera ) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates the first commercially available , modern optical computer mice were the microsoft intellimouse with intellieye and intellimouse explorer , introduced in 1999 using technology developed by hewlett-packard other manufacturers soon followed microsoft 's lead using components manufactured by the hp spin-off agilent technologies , and over the next several years mechanical mice became obsolete in 1992 william holland was awarded us patent 5,089,712 and john ertel , william holland , kent vincent , rueiming jamp , and richard baldwin were awarded us patent 5,149,980 for measuring linear paper advance in a printer by correlating images of paper fibers allen , david beard , mark t blalock , richard a baumgartner , thomas hornak , mark t smith , and barclay j as early as 1998 , sun microsystems provided a laser mouse with their sun sparcstation servers and workstations depue , and douglas m the laser illumination enables superior surface tracking compared to led-illuminated optical mice in august 2009 , logitech introduced mice with two lasers , to track on glass and glossy surfaces better ; they dubbed them a '' darkfield '' laser sensor a typical implementation ( by logitech ) has four power states , where the sensor is pulsed at different rates per second : 11500 : full on , for accurate response while moving , illumination appears bright 110 : standby 12 : sleep state movement can be detected in any of these states ; some mice turn the sensor fully off in the sleep state , requiring a button click to wake however , they generally can not track on glossy and transparent surfaces , including some mouse-pads , causing the cursor to drift unpredictably during operation
