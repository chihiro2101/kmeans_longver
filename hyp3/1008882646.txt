the radius of the condyles ' curvature in the sagittal plane becomes smaller toward the back this diminishing radius produces a series of involute midpoints ( i.e located on a spiral ) the articular capsule has a synovial and a fibrous membrane separated by fatty deposits behind , the synovial membrane is attached to the margins of the two femoral condyles which produces two extensions similar to the anterior recess the largest communicative bursa is the suprapatellar bursa described above cartilage is a thin , elastic tissue that protects the bone and makes certain that the joint surfaces can slide easily over each other these two disks , the medial meniscus and the lateral meniscus , consist of connective tissue with extensive collagen fibers containing cartilage-like cells the ligaments surrounding the knee joint offer stability by limiting movements and , together with the menisci and several bursae , protect the articular capsule the posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) stretches from medial condyle of femur to the posterior intercondylar area this ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur the meniscotibial ligaments ( or '' coronary '' ) stretches from inferior edges of the mensici to the periphery of the tibial plateaus the fibular collateral ligament ( lcl a.k.a it is separate from both the joint capsule and the lateral meniscus the oblique popliteal ligament is a radiation of the tendon of the semimembranosus on the medial side , from where it is direct laterally and proximally the knee joint is called '' mobile '' because the femur and lateral meniscus move over the tibia during rotation , while the femur rolls and glides over both menisci during extension-flexion the total range of motion is dependent on several parameters such as soft-tissue restraints , active insufficiency , and hamstring tightness with the knee extended both the lateral and medial collateral ligaments , as well as the anterior part of the anterior cruciate ligament , are taut furthermore , the dorsal fibers of the tibial collateral ligament become tensed during extreme medial rotation and the ligament also reduces the lateral rotation to 45–60° '' back of knee pain causes the most common knee disorder is generally known as patellofemoral syndrome.the majority of minor cases of knee pain can be treated at home with rest and ice but more serious injuries do require surgery care the second major class of knee disorder involves a tear , slippage , or dislocation that impairs the structural ability of the knee to balance the leg ( patellofemoral instability syndrome ) cartilage lesions can be caused by : accidents ( fractures ) injuries the removal of a meniscus anterior cruciate ligament injury posterior cruciate ligament injury posterolateral corner injury medial knee injuries considerable strain on the knee any kind of work during which the knees undergo heavy stress may also be detrimental to cartilage overall fitness and knee injury the same activity such as climbing stairs may cause pain from patellofemoral compression for someone who is physically unfit , but not for someone else ( or even for that person at a different time ) in sports that place great pressure on the knees , especially with twisting forces , it is common to tear one or more ligaments or cartilages anterior cruciate ligament injury the injury is common during sports minor tears of the anterior cruciate ligament may heal over time , but a torn acl requires surgery activities that induce pain usually delay healing rest , ice and compression do help in most cases varus or valgus deformity also in quadrupeds , particularly horses , ungulates , and elephants , the layman 's term '' knee '' also commonly refers to the forward-facing joint in the foreleg , the carpus , which is homologous to the human wrist in birds , the '' knee '' refers to the joints between the femur and tibiotarsus , and also the patella ( when present ) the layman 's term '' knee '' may also refer to the ( lower and often more visible due to not being covered by feathers ) joint between the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus , which is homologous to the human ankle
