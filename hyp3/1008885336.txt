more than half of power in canada is hydroelectricity , and mains electricity is often referred to there as '' hydro '' for a list of voltages , frequencies , and wall plugs by country , see mains electricity by country worldwide , many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting some city areas may use standards different from that of the surrounding countryside ( e.g the us energy information administration ( eia ) has published : estimated us residential electricity consumption by end use , for the year 2016 how is electricity used in u.s some areas of the uk still have 250 & nbsp ; volts for legacy reasons , but these also fall within the 10 % tolerance band of 230 & nbsp ; volts the holborn viaduct station was used as a proof of concept for the construction of the much larger pearl street station in manhattan , the world 's first permanent commercial central power plant ac circuits adopted the same form during the war of the currents , allowing lamps to be run at around 110 & nbsp ; v and major appliances to be connected to 220 & nbsp ; v after world war ii the standard voltage in the u.s the most common frequency was 133⅓ & nbsp ; hz today most 60 & nbsp ; hz systems deliver nominal 120/240 & nbsp ; v , and most 50 & nbsp ; hz nominally 230 & nbsp ; v the significant exceptions are in brazil , which has a synchronized 60 & nbsp ; hz grid with both 127 & nbsp ; v and 220 & nbsp ; v as standard voltages in different regions , and japan , which has two frequencies : 50 & nbsp ; hz for east japan and 60 & nbsp ; hz for west japan at each customer 's service , the step-down transformer has up to five taps to allow some range of adjustment , usually ±5 % of the nominal voltage the stability of the voltage and frequency supplied to customers varies among countries and regions in contrast , harmonic distortion is usually caused by conditions of the load or generator pt : eletricidade doméstica
