foiled again retired on january 1 , 2019 , but the then 15-year-old gelding left an indelible mark in harness racing annals he compiled a 331/109–70–46 record and earned an all-time record us 7,635,588 in purse money in continental europe , races are conducted exclusively among trotters , whereas in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom and the united states races are also held for pacers pacing races constitute 80 % to 90 % of the harness races conducted in north america - while the clear majority of harness racing in australia and new zealand are also now for pacers , even though the sport is colloquially still known as 'the trots ' pacing horses are faster and ( most important to the bettor ) less likely to break stride ( a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing ) another kind of start is a standing start , where there are tapes or imaginary lines across the track behind which the horses either stand stationary or trot in circles in pairs in a specific pattern to hit the starting line as a group many european – and some australian and new zealand – races use a standing start , although this increases the chance of a 'false start ' where one or a number of horses commence 'off-stride ' and gallop the driver ( not a '' jockey '' , as in thoroughbred racing ) carries a light whip chiefly used to signal the horse by tapping and to make noise by striking the sulky shaft sweden is '' the locomotive '' of harness racing in scandinavia in sweden there are 33 racing tracks , and in finland 43 one of them ( jägersro ) is a combined thoroughbred and standardbred track , while another is only used once every year at solvalla in the suburbs of stockholm the premier standardbred mile race is held in late may every year , elitloppet ( the elite race ) other important annual races are svenskt travkriterium , a race restricted to three-year-olds , also hosted at solvalla and swedish trotting derby ( open for the best four-year-old horses ) hosted in september at jägersro in malmö other important harness racing arenas in scandinavia are åby outside gothenburg , mantorp , axevalla , bergsåker , boden ( almost at the polar circle ) and charlottenlund in danish capital copenhagen in pure mare horse races , horses from higher classification get 20 , 40 or up to 60 meter extra to run an example of such a race could be silver division against class ii horses 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 , 14 , 15 have all horses in front of them how well this succeeds depends on the horse , the starting position and how the opponents drive their horses after the initial fight for good running position , the horses usually form two rows or tracks though all kind of trot betting in terms of money , is the most popular type of betting in sweden , attendances at the races do n't correspond to this the huge popularity of trot betting in sweden '' spills over '' to the neighboring norway ( 11 racing tracks ) , finland ( 43 ) and denmark ( 9 ) other countries in europe trotting sport and betting also exist in austria , belgium , germany , hungary , italy , the netherlands , malta , russia and ireland though the vast majority of races are one mile , races are contested on several different size tracks the most common are 1/2 mile , 5/8 mile , and 1 mile tracks this change was mainly for safety reasons ; it allows a driver to pull off to the inside of the course if necessary , such as when their horse breaks stride but they can not move to the outside due to being boxed in , thus avoiding injury to himself , his horse , and other competitors australia and new zealand another large difference is that in australian racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges , often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the '' death seat '' or simply '' the death '' ( known as '' facing the breeze '' in new zealand ) , as this horse covers more ground than the leader in both new zealand and australia the same system of an 'open lane ' operates , although in australia it is called a 'sprint lane ' and in new zealand a 'passing lane ' the breeding and racing of standardbred horses is both a dedicated pastime and profession for participants in the industry united states and canada important annual races include the hambletonian for 3-year-old trotters , the little brown jug for 3-year-old pacers , and the breeders crown series of twelve races covering each of the traditional categories of age , gait and sex the most prestigious events for three year olds including the victoria derby , the new south wales derby and the australian derby there are also the new zealand derby and the great northern derby for three year olds , and the dominion handicap and rowe cup for trotters the prix d'amérique at vincennes hippodrome near paris , france is widely considered to be the most prestigious event of the european racing year
