the first dnsbl was the real-time blackhole list ( rbl ) , created in 1997 , at first as a border gateway protocol ( bgp ) feed by paul vixie , and then as a dnsbl by eric ziegast as part of vixie 's mail abuse prevention system ( maps ) ; dave rand at abovenet was its first subscriber the intent of the rbl was that sites using it would refuse traffic from sites which supported spam â€” whether by actively sending spam , or in other ways uri dnsbls were created when it was determined that much spam made it past spam filters during that short time frame between the first use of a spam-sending ip address and the point where that sending ip address was first listed on major sending-ip-based dnsbls in many cases , such elusive spams contain in their links domain names or ip addresses ( collectively referred to as a uris ) where that uri was already spotted in previously caught spam and where that uri is not found in non-spam e-mail after surbl was created , some of the volunteers for surbl started the second major uri dnsbl , uribl unlike other uribls , the dbl only lists domain names , not ip addresses , since spamhaus provides other lists of ip addresses but they are different dnsbls intended for public use usually have specific , published policies as to what a listing means , and must be operated accordingly to attain or sustain public confidence optionally , if the client is listed , look up the name as a text record ( '' txt '' record ) the domain name to query is prepended to the dns list host as follows : example.net.dnslist.example.com where dnslist.example.com is the dns list host and example.net is the queried domain generally if an a record is returned the name is listed dnsbl policies differ from one another on three fronts : goals as a result , there is no definitive taxonomy for dnsbls ; white list : a listing is an affirmative indication of essentially absolute trust ; black list : a listing is a negative indication of essentially absolute distrust ; grey list : most frequently seen as one word ( greylist or greylisting ) not involving dnsbls directly , but using temporary deferral of mail from unfamiliar sources to allow for the development of a public reputation ( such as dnsbl listings ) or to discourage speed-focused spamming a drawback of using the direct dnsbl support in most mtas is that sources not on any list require checking all of the dnsbls being used with relatively little utility to caching the negative results in some cases this can cause a significant slowdown in mail delivery this type of dnsbl lists ip addresses submitted by isps as dynamic and therefore presumably unsuitable to send email directly ; the end-user is supposed to use the isp 's mailserver for all sending of email some lists have unclear listing criteria and delisting may not happen automatically nor quickly uceprotect.net ) or donation ( e.g a number of parties , such as the electronic frontier foundation and peacefire , have raised concerns about some use of dnsbls by isps spammers have pursued lawsuits against dnsbl operators on similar grounds : in 2003 , a newly formed corporation calling itself '' emarketersamerica '' filed suit against a number of dnsbl operators in florida court the suit was eventually dismissed for lack of standing this decision was later overturned by an appeals court .
