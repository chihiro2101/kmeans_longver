pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering , which are forms of feeling bad but there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute well-being , like health , virtue , knowledge or the fulfillment of desires axiological hedonists hold that pleasure is the only thing that has intrinsic value the appreciation of cultural artifacts and activities such as art , music , dancing , and literature is often pleasurable chapter v , an introduction to the principles of morals and legislation , bentham , 1789 , some commentators see 'complex pleasures ' including wit and sudden realisation , complex pleasure : forms of feeling in german literature , stanley corngold , stanford press , 1998 and some see a wide range of pleasurable feelings an alternative terminology refers to these theories as phenomenalism and intentionalism in natural language , the term '' pleasure '' is primarily associated with sensory pleasures like the enjoyment of food or sex so a pleasurable experience of eating chocolate involves a sensation of the taste of chocolate together with a pleasure-sensation according to this approach , pleasurable experiences differ in content ( drinking a milkshake , playing chess ) but agree in feeling or hedonic tone the force of this objection comes from the intuition that the variety of pleasure-experiences is just too wide to point out one quality shared by all , for example , the quality shared by enjoying a milkshake and enjoying a chess game another argument against desire theories is that desire and pleasure can come apart : we can have a desire for things that are not enjoyable and we can enjoy things without desiring to do so dispositional theories try to account for pleasure in terms of dispositions , often by including insights from both the quality theories and the attitude theories some of the problems of the regular desire theory can be avoided this way since the disposition does not need to be realized for there to be pleasure , thereby taking into account that desire and pleasure can come apart ethical hedonism takes the strongest position on this relation in stating that considerations of increasing pleasure and decreasing pain fully determine what we should do or which action is right within this family , classical utilitarianism draws the closest connection between pleasure and right action by holding that the agent should maximize the sum-total of everyone 's happiness quantitative hedonists , following jeremy bentham , hold that the specific content or quality of a pleasure-experience is not relevant to its value , which only depends on its quantitative features : intensity and duration we take pleasure from many things that are not beautiful , which is why beauty is usually defined in terms of a special type of pleasure : aesthetic or disinterested pleasure a pleasure is disinterested if it is indifferent to the existence of the beautiful object for example , a cold jaded critic may still be a good judge of beauty due to her years of experience but lack the joy that initially accompanied her work eusebius praeparatio evangelica chapter 18 counsels and maxims , chapter 1 , general rules section 1 pleasure is considered one of the core dimensions of emotion for example , a sweater that has been worn by a celebrity is more desired than an otherwise identical sweater that has not , though considerably less so if it has been washed how pleasure works : the new science of why we like what we like ( 2010 ) 280 pages draws on neuroscience , philosophy , child-development research , and behavioral economics in a study of our desires , attractions , and tastes the paradox of hedonism states that pleasure-seeking behavior commonly fails also in another way cognitive biases in regard to pleasure include the peakâ€“end rule , the focusing illusion , the nearness bias and the future bias for example , the memory of a painful colonoscopy is improved if the examination is extended by three minutes in which the scope is still inside but not moved anymore , resulting in a moderately uncomfortable sensation this principle states that the temporal location of a benefit or a harm is not important for its normative significance : a rational agent should care to the same extend about all parts of her life on the negative side , we prefer painful experiences to be distant rather than near . brain and reward system while all pleasurable stimuli can be seen as rewards , some rewards do not evoke pleasure in the past , there has been debate as to whether pleasure is experienced by other animals rather than being an exclusive property of humankind ; however , it is now known that animals do experience pleasure , as measured by objective behavioral and neural hedonic responses to pleasurable stimuli the pleasure center : trust your animal instincts ( 2009 )
