projection ( plain ) radiography the x-rays are projected through the body onto a detector ; an image is formed based on which rays pass through ( and are detected ) versus those that are absorbed or scattered in the patient ( and thus are not detected ) r√∂ntgen discovered x-rays on november 8 , 1895 and received the first nobel prize in physics for their discovery in 1901 the film is then developed chemically and an image appears on the film fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of x-ray imaging , in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system in ct , an x-ray tube opposite an x-ray detector ( or detectors ) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate around a patient , producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image ( tomogram ) ct scanning has become the test of choice in diagnosing some urgent and emergent conditions , such as cerebral hemorrhage , pulmonary embolism ( clots in the arteries of the lungs ) , aortic dissection ( tearing of the aortic wall ) , appendicitis , diverticulitis , and obstructing kidney stones continuing improvements in ct technology , including faster scanning times and improved resolution , have dramatically increased the accuracy and usefulness of ct scanning , which may partially account for increased use in medical diagnosis no ionizing radiation is involved , but the quality of the images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person ( ultrasonographer ) performing the exam and the patient 's body size ultrasound is also limited by its inability to image through air pockets ( lungs , bowel loops ) or bone the radio signals are collected by small antennae , called coils , placed near the area of interest the most commonly used tracers are technetium-99m , iodine-123 , iodine-131 , gallium-67 , indium-111 , thallium-201 and fludeoxyglucose ( 18f ) ( 18f-fdg ) the heart , lungs , thyroid , liver , brain , gallbladder , and bones are commonly evaluated for particular conditions using these techniques in the most modern devices , nuclear medicine images can be fused with a ct scan taken quasisimultaneously , so the physiology information can be overlaid or coregistered with the anatomical structures to improve diagnostic accuracy positron emission tomography ( pet ) scanning deals with positrons instead of gamma rays detected by gamma cameras pet/mri fusion , largely practiced in academic and research settings , could potentially play a crucial role in fine detail of brain imaging , breast cancer screening , and small joint imaging of the foot some of these procedures are done for purely diagnostic purposes ( e.g by minimizing the physical trauma to the patient , peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery times , as well as hospital stays however , beforehand the geometrical adjustment and general alignment of optical density should be done another possibility of radiographic image analysis is to study second order features , e.g teleradiology is the transmission of radiographic images from one location to another for interpretation by an appropriately trained professional , usually a radiologist or reporting radiographer it is most often used to allow rapid interpretation of emergency room , icu and other emergent examinations after hours of usual operation , at night and on weekends the major advantage of teleradiology is the ability to use different time zones to provide real-time emergency radiology services around-the-clock after residency , radiologists may pursue one or two years of additional specialty fellowship training this computer-based examination is given twice a year in chicago and tucson it encompasses 18 categories a pass of all 18 is a pass a fail on one to five categories is a conditioned exam and the resident will need to retake and pass the failed categories recertification examinations are taken every 10 years , with additional required continuing medical education as outlined in the maintenance of certification document examples of subspeciality training in radiology include abdominal imaging , thoracic imaging , cross-sectional/ultrasound , mri , musculoskeletal imaging , interventional radiology , neuroradiology , interventional neuroradiology , paediatric radiology , nuclear medicine , emergency radiology , breast imaging and women 's imaging campbell university school of osteopathic medicine also integrates imaging material into their curriculum early in the first year they are certified in either diagnostic radiology or radiation oncology by the american college of veterinary radiology this comprises a medical physics and anatomy examination successful completion of these allows them to complete the frcr by completing part 2b , which includes rapid reporting , and a long case discussion most often if a radiographer operates a list autonomously then they are acting as the operator and practitioner under the ionising radiation ( medical exposures ) regulations 2000 the radiology training program in italy increased from four to five years in 2008 radiologists in singapore complete a five-year undergraduate medicine degree followed by a one-year internship and then a five-year residency program in 2006 sir proposed a pathway resulting in certification in ir as a speciality ; this was eventually accepted by the abr in 2007 and was presented to the american board of medical specialities ( abms ) in 2009 , which rejected it because it did not include enough diagnostic radiology ( dr ) training while many countries have an interventional radiology society , there is also the european-wide cardiovascular and interventional radiological society of europe , whose aim is to support teaching , science , research and clinical practice in the field by hosting meetings , educational workshops and promoting patient safety initiatives
