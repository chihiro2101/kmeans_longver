compared to the 220 nm geforce 256 , geforce 2 is built on a 180 & nbsp ; nm manufacturing process , making the silicon more dense and allowing for more transistors and a higher clock speed however , the ultra loses its lead when anti-aliasing is enabled , because of the geforce 3 's new memory bandwidth/fillrate efficiency mechanisms ; plus the geforce 3 has a superior next-generation feature set with programmable vertex and pixel shaders for directx 8.0 games faster than the gts and pro but slower than the ultra , the geforce 2 ti performed competitively against the radeon r100 , although the 7500 had the advantage of dual-display support this mid-range geforce 2 release was replaced by the geforce 4 mx series as the budget/performance choice in january 2002 the mx series also provided dual-display support , something not found in the regular geforce 256 and geforce 2 the radeon ve had the advantage of somewhat better dual-monitor display software , but it did not offer hardware t & l , an emerging 3d rendering feature of the day that was the major attraction of direct3d 7 the non-mx geforce 2 line was reduced in price and saw the addition of the geforce 2 ti , in order to offer a mid-range alternative to the high-end geforce 3 product windows 2000 , 32-bit windows xp & media center edition : 93.71 released on november 2 , 2006 ; download for windows 2000 , 32-bit windows xp & media center edition also available beta driver 93.81 released on november 28 , 2006 ; forceware release 90 version 93.81 - beta 3dfx voodoo 5 ati radeon powervr ( kyro )
