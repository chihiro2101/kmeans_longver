the species inia geoffrensis was described by henri marie ducrotay de blainville in 1817 humboldtiana ( orinoco river dolphin ) ; while the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy only recognizes the first two of these boliviensis was a different species inia geoffrensis boliviensis has populations in the upper reaches of the madeira river , upstream of the rapids of teotonio , in bolivia adult males reach a maximum length and weight of ( average and ( average , while females reach a length and weight of ( mean and ( average the texture of the body is robust and strong but flexible the length of its fins allows the animal to perform a circular movement , allowing for exceptional maneuverability to swim through the flooded forest but decreasing its speed anterior teeth are conical and later have ridges on the inside of the crown it has a melon on the head , the shape of which can be modified by muscular control when used for biosonar an individual named baby at the duisburg zoo , germany , lived at least 46 years , spending 45 years , 9 months at the zoo pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the amazon , but average is three however , dolphins in captivity may not show the same behavior that they do in their natural environment , where they have been reported to hold the oars of the fishermen , rub against the boat , pluck underwater plants , and play with sticks , logs , clay , turtles , snakes , and fish when they surface , the tips of the snout , melon and dorsal fins appear simultaneously , the tail rarely showing before diving later , it was shown that males were larger than females and are documented wielding an aggressive sexual behavior in the wild and in captivity in captivity , courtship and mating foreplay have been documented the period of birthing coincides with the flood season , and this may provide an advantage because the females and their offspring remain in flooded areas longer than males at birth , calves are long and in captivity have registered a growth of per year the relatively long duration of breastfeeding and parenting suggests a strong mother-child bond most couples observed in their natural environment consist of a female and her calf the prey size is between , with an average of the diet is more diverse during the wet season , when fish are spread in flooded areas outside riverbeds , thus becoming more difficult to catch however , they are predominantly crepuscular for each click produced a multitude of echoes are likely to return to the echolocating animal almost on top of each other which makes object discrimination difficult they are present in six countries in south america : bolivia , brazil , colombia , ecuador , peru , and venezuela , in an area covering about in studies conducted during the rainy season , the density observed in the flood plain was 18 animals per square km , while on the banks of rivers and lakes ranged from 1.8 to 5.8 individuals per square km in the pacaya-samiria national reserve , peru , photo-identification is used to recognize individuals based on pigmentation patterns , scars and abnormalities in the beak 72 individuals were recognized , of which 25 were again observed between 1991 and 2000 the longest distance in one day was , with an average of the amazon river dolphin has historically been kept in dolphinariums one of these ecosystems is a floodplain , or a várzea forest , and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption várzea consists of muddy river waters containing a vast number and diversity of nutrient rich species human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species , the tambaqui ( colossoma macropomum ) and the pirapitinga ( piaractus brachypomus ) , resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the amazon river dolphin increasing demand for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions the species is listed in appendix ii of the cites ( cites ) , and appendix ii of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals , because it has an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements a series of recommendations were issued to ensure proper follow-up to the species , among which is the implementation and publication of studies on the structure of populations , making a record of the distribution of the species , information about potential threats as the magnitude of fishing operations and location of pipelines in september 2012 , bolivian president evo morales enacted a law to protect the dolphin and declared it a national treasure in 2018 , the species was listed on the red list of endangered species she goes to the house of a married man , places him under a spell to keep
