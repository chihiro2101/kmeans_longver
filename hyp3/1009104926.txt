this framework did not presume a concept of energy in general , but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work this equation may be described as follows : : :in a thermodynamic process involving a closed system , the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it in 1907 , george h also bryan had written about this in the enzyklopädie der mathematischen wissenschaften , volume 3 , p also in 1906 jean baptiste perrin wrote about it in bull de la société français de philosophie , volume 6 , p but also in the work of many others . conceptually revised statement , according to the mechanical approach '' glansdorff , p , prigogine , i , ( 1971 ) , p de groot , s this is not the ad hoc definition of '' reduced heat flux '' of haase ( 1963/1969 ) , p in the case of a flowing system of only one chemical constituent , in the lagrangian representation , there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter ter haar , j.f gregg , springer , berlin , ( 1851 ) , series 4 , 2 , 1–21 , 102–119 also available on google books non-equilibrium thermodynamics , north-holland , amsterdam the principles of chemical equilibrium the thermodynamics of irreversible processes jost , of physical chemistry jost , academic press , new york , lcn 73–117081 reprinted in helmholtz , h von ( 1882 ) , wissenschaftliche abhandlungen , band 1 , j & nbsp ; 114–162 , reprinted as volume 7 of series 7 , the sources of science , edited by h chemical thermodynamics , mcgraw-hill book company , new york ( 1970 ) , classical thermodynamics , translated by e halberstadt , wiley–interscience , london , brian pippard ( 1957/1966 ) elements of classical thermodynamics for advanced students of physics , original publication 1957 , reprint 1966 , cambridge university press , cambridge uk max planck ( 1897/1903 ) étude thermodynamique des phénomènes irréversibles , dunod , paris , and desoers , liège generalized thermodynamics , m.i.t the tragicomical history of thermodynamics , 1822–1854 , springer , new york , misn-0-158 , the first law of thermodynamics ( pdf file ) by jerzy borysowicz for project physnet
