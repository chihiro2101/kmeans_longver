in 1939 , sidney cotton and flying officer maurice longbottom of the raf suggested that airborne reconnaissance may be a task better suited to fast , small aircraft which would use their speed and high service ceiling to avoid detection and interception in 1945 , daily intake of material averaged 25,000 negatives and 60,000 prints by ve-day , the print library , which documented and stored worldwide cover , held 5,000,000 prints from which 40,000 reports had been produced together with other members of his reconnaissance squadron , he pioneered the technique of high-altitude , high-speed photography that was instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets '' operation crossbow '' , bbc2 , broadcast 15 may 2011 according to r.v highly specialized and secretive strategic reconnaissance aircraft , or spy planes , such as the lockheed u-2 and its successor , the sr-71 blackbird were developed by the united states '' between 1959 and 1984 the u.s launched around 200 such satellites under the codenames corona and gambit , with ultimate photographic resolution ( ground-resolution distance ) better than between 1961 and 1994 the ussr launched perhaps 500 zenit film-return satellites , which returned both the film and the camera to earth in a pressurized capsule these satellites used charge-coupled devices , predecessors to modern digital cameras , rather than film unmanned aerial vehicles have been developed for imagery and signals intelligence though the resolution of satellite photographs , which must be taken from distances of hundreds of kilometers , is usually poorer than photographs taken by air , satellites offer the possibility of coverage for much of the earth , including hostile territory , without exposing human pilots to the risk of being shot down the formula for the highest possible resolution of an optical system with a circular aperture is given by the rayleigh criterion : : \sin \theta 1.22 \frac , where θ is the angular resolution , λ is the wavelength of light , and d is the diameter of the lens or mirror were the hubble space telescope , with a 2.4 m telescope , designed for photographing earth , it would be diffraction-limited to resolutions greater than 16 & nbsp ; cm ( 6 & nbsp ; inches ) for green light ( \lambda \approx 550 nm ) at its orbital altitude of 590 & nbsp ; km some of the multi-spectral sensors , such as thermal measurement , are more electro-optical masint than true imint platforms due to the need to produce near-real time intelligence assessments based upon collected imagery , first phase imagery analysis is rarely compared to collateral intelligence maya quiñones , william gould , and carlos d
