complex technical drawings were made in renaissance times , such as the drawings of leonardo da vinci rolt 's biography of isambard kingdom brunel for it is safe to assume that he had mastered the art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing it had been evolved by gaspard monge of mezieres in 1765 but had remained a military secret until 1794 and was therefore unknown in england these apply widely in the united states , although iso 8015 ( geometrical product specifications ( gps ) — fundamentals — concepts , principles and rules ) is now also important the only way not to invoke the iso gps system is to invoke a national or other standard ) and of course the tools also include drawing boards ( drafting boards ) or tables cad provides their virtual equivalents systems of dimensioning and tolerancing drawings convey the following critical information : geometry – the shape of the object ; represented as views ; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles , such as front , top , side , etc tolerances – the allowable variations for each dimension center – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter they are the thickest lines on a drawing and done with a pencil softer than hb 2h pencil type d lines are similar to type c , except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks these are dotted lines , but a long line of 10–20 & nbsp ; mm , then a 1 & nbsp ; mm gap , then a small line of 2 & nbsp ; mm in most cases , a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features , and several views are used first-angle projection is the iso 128 and is primarily used in europe as shown above , the determination of what surface constitutes the front , back , top , and bottom varies depending on the projection method used bertoline , gary r introduction to graphics communications for engineers ( 4th ed new york , ny isometric projection corresponds to rotation of the object by ± 45° about the vertical axis , followed by rotation of approximately ± 35.264° arcsin ( tan ( 30° ) ) about the horizontal axis starting from an orthographic projection view projected views ( either auxiliary or multiview ) which show a cross section of the source object along the specified cut plane these views are commonly used to show internal features with more clarity than may be available using regular projections or hidden lines nuts , screws , washers ) are typically not sectioned plans are usually '' scale drawings '' , meaning that the plans are drawn at specific ratio relative to the actual size of the place or object for example , a floor plan may be drawn at 1:50 ( 1:48 or ″ 1′ 0″ ) whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:25 ( 1:24 or ″ 1′ 0″ ) a 2d pencil drawing can be inaccurately foreshortened and skewed ( and thus not to scale ) , yet still be a completely valid part definition as long as the labeled dimensions are the only dimensions used , and no scaling of the drawing by the user occurs ) but if a mathematical model—essentially , a vector graphic—is declared to be the official definition of the part , then any amount of '' scaling the drawing '' can make sense ; there may still be an error in the model , in the sense that what was intended is not depicted ( modeled ) ; but there can be no error of the '' not to scale '' type—because the mathematical vectors and curves are replicas , not symbols , of the part features which , under the rule of '' do not scale drawing '' , never really did that much for them anyway these developed further refinements in the second half of the twentieth century , when photocopying became cheap however , the international organization for standardization ( iso ) called for four pen widths and set a colour code for each : 0.25 ( white ) , 0.35 ( yellow ) , 0.5 ( brown ) , 0.7 ( blue ) ; these nibs produced lines that related to various text character heights and the iso paper sizes a drawing on a3 may be enlarged to a2 or reduced to a4 with the goals of legibility and uniformity , styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability engineering drawings use a sans-serif script , formed by a series of short strokes traditional locations for the revisions block are the top right ( most commonly ) or adjoining the title block in some way usually views and sections are called out with cross-references to specific zones of the field often a drawing is divided into zones by an alphanumeric grid , with zone labels along the margins , such as a , b , c , d up the sides and 1,2,3,4,5,6 along the top and bottom as in many technical fields , a wide array of abbreviations and symbols have been developed in engineering drawing during the 20th and 21st centuries the different line types are colored for clarity relationship to model-based definition ( mbd/dpd ) in mbd , the information captured by the cad software app is fed automatically into a cam app ( computer-aided manufacturing ) , which ( with or without postprocessing apps ) creates code in other languages such as g-code to be executed by a cnc machine tool ( numerical control ) , 3d printer , or ( increasingly ) a hybrid machine tool that uses both thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing hick and sons & ndash ;
