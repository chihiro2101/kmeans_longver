thumb jodrell bank was first used for academic purposes in 1939 when the university of manchester 's department of botany purchased three fields from the leighs lovell , the story of jodrell bank the site was first used for astrophysics in 1945 , when bernard lovell used some equipment left over from world war ii , including a gun laying radar , to investigate cosmic rays this was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point , and a maximum at 90 degrees to it 15 astronomer by chance , p the telescope was replaced by the steerable lovell telescope and the mark ii telescope was subsequently built at the same location 29 the telescope became operational in mid-1957 , in time for the launch of the soviet union 's sputnik 1 , the world 's first artificial satellite lovell , the story of jodrell bank , p tracking space probes only took a fraction of the lovell telescope 's observing time and the remainder used for scientific observations including using radar to measure the distance to the moon and to venus ; lovell , out of the zenith , pp . mark ii and iii telescopes it was constructed in 1964 as well as operating as a standalone telescope , it has been used as an interferometer with the lovell telescope , and is now primarily used as part of the merlin project it was built in 1966 and decommissioned in 1996 the mark va was similar to the mark v but with a smaller dish of and a design using prestressed concrete , similar to the mark ii ( the previous two designs more closely resembled the lovell telescope ) when the 42 & nbsp ; ft was installed , a smaller dish , the '' 7 & nbsp ; m '' ( actually 6.4 m , or 21 & nbsp ; ft , in diameter ) was installed and is used for undergraduate teaching it has been decommissioned at a wavelength of 6 & nbsp ; cm ( 5 & nbsp ; ghz frequency ) , merlin has a resolution of 50 & nbsp ; milliarcseconds which is comparable to that of the hst at optical wavelengths . very long baseline interferometry jodrell bank has been involved with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) since the late 1960s ; the lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968 , with other telescopes at algonquin and penticton in canada lovell , out of the zenith , pp in april 2015 it was announced that jodrell bank would be the permanent home of the ska headquarters for the period of operation expected for the telescope ( over 50 years ) he was succeeded in 1980 by francis graham-smith , followed by rod davies around 1990 and andrew lyne in 1999 in october 2010 , prof simon garrington is the jbca associate director for the jodrell bank observatory in 2016 , prof as director jbca , prof in may 2017 jodrell bank entered into a partnership with the breakthrough listen initiative and will share information with jodrell bank 's team , who wish to conduct an independent seti search via its 76-m radio telescope and e-merlin array the visitor centre is open to daily and organises public outreach events , including public lectures , star parties , and '' ask an astronomer '' sessions in january 2018 , it became the uk 's candidate for world heritage status in july 2011 the visitor centre and observatory hosted '' jodrell bank live '' – a rock concert with bands including the flaming lips , british sea power , wave machines , ok go and alice gold there is an astronomy podcast from the observatory , named the jodcast on 9 july 2008 , it was reported that , following an independent review , stfc had reversed its initial position and would now guarantee funding of £2.5 million annually for three years it was intended to be a filming location for logopolis ( tom baker 's final doctor who serial ) but budget restrictions prevented this and another location with a superimposed model of a radio telescope was used instead on the same date five other buildings on the site were designated at grade ii ; namely the searchlight telescope , the control building , the park royal building , the electrical workshop , and the link hut
