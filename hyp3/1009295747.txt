some rare forms of bladder cancer like urachal cancer produce mucin , which is then excreted in the urine causing it to be thick tobacco smoking is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer ; in most populations , smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women , however these proportions have reduced over recent years since there are fewer smokers in europe and north america occupations at risk are bus drivers , rubber workers , painters , motor mechanics , leather ( including shoe ) workers , blacksmiths , machine setters , and mechanics infection with schistosoma haematobium ( bilharzia or schistosomiasis ) may cause bladder cancer , specially of the squamous cell type 10â€“20 % risk increase ) associated with bladder cancer , for example , obesity p53 and rb gene mutations are implicated in high-grade muscle invasive tumors deletion of both copies of the gstm1 gene has a modest increase in risk of bladder cancer n-acetyltransferase helps in detoxification of carcinogens like aromatic amines ( also present in cigarette smoke ) basal subtype are subdivided into basal and claudin low-type group and are aggressive and show metastasis at presentation , however they respond to platinum based chemotherapy luminal subtype can be subdivided into p53-like and luminal a rigid cystoscopy is used under general anesthesia in the operating room and can support remedial work and biopsies as well as more extensive tumor removal in photodynamic detection , a dye is instilled into the bladder with the help of a catheter if invasive or high grade ( includes carcinoma in situ ) cancer is detected on turbt , an mri and/or ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis or urogram and ct scan or x-ray chest should be conducted for disease staging and to look for cancer spread ( metastasis ) urine cytology can be obtained in voided urine or at the time of the cystoscopy ( '' bladder washing '' ) there are newer non-invasive urine bound markers available as aids in the diagnosis of bladder cancer , including human complement factor h-related protein , high-molecular-weight carcinoembryonic antigen , and nuclear matrix protein 22 ( nmp22 ) likewise , nmp22 is a sandwich elisa and nmp22 bladderchek is a dipstick immunoassay , both of them detect nuclear mitotic apparatus protein ( numa ) tumor marker ( a type of nuclear matrix protein ) urovysion is a fluorescence in situ hybridization which detects aneuploidy in chromosomes 3 , 7 , 17 and loss of the 9p21 locus sensitivities across biomarkers ranged from 0.57 to 0.82 and specificities from 0.74 to 0.88 in 2018 , the age adjusted rates of new cases of bladder cancer was 6 cases per 100,000 people and age adjusted death rate was 2 deaths per 100,000 people the risk of bladder cancer occurrence is four times higher in men than in women smoking can only partially explain this higher rates in men in western hemisphere this hypothesis is also supported by the fact that men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for unrelated reason seem to have a lower risk of developing bladder cancer one of the common signs of bladder cancer is hematuria and is quite often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection in women , leading to a delay in diagnosis among the 11,800 new cases , 9100 will be in men and 2700 in women
