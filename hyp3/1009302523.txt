complex eyes can distinguish shapes and colours the cone cells ( for colour ) and the rod cells ( for low-light contrasts ) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision the visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell ( s ) some arthropods , including many strepsiptera , have compound eyes of only a few facets , each with a retina capable of creating an image , creating vision in this , they differ from most other arthropods , which have soft eyes in organisms dwelling near deep-sea vents , compound eyes have been secondarily simplified and adapted to see the infrared produced by the hot vents—in this way the bearers can avoid being boiled alive eye types can be categorised into '' simple eyes '' , with one concave photoreceptive surface , and '' compound eyes '' , which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface pit eyes , also known as stemma , are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot , to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light the main difference is that photoreceptors are g protein-coupled receptor but trp are ion channels the resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens , which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable such a non-homogeneous lens is necessary for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius , to 2.5 radii heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times : four or more times in gastropods , once in the copepods , once in the annelids , once in the cephalopods , and once in the chitons , which have aragonite lenses spherical lenses produce spherical aberration thus , animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens the scallop pecten has up to 100 millimetre-scale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell compound eyes are common in arthropods , annelids and some bivalved molluscs the result is an image at half the radius of the eye , which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are this type of compound eye , for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition can not occur , is normally found in nocturnal insects , because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes , though at the cost of reduced resolution this eye type functions by refracting light , then using a parabolic mirror to focus the image ; it combines features of superposition and apposition eyes there are some exceptions from the types mentioned above some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye , a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes the outer layer is highly pigmented , continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium , and constitutes the cells of the dilator muscle it is produced by certain retinal cells this is based upon the shared genetic features of all eyes ; that is , all modern eyes , varied as they are , have their origins in a proto-eye believed to have evolved some 540 million years ago , and the pax6 gene is considered a key factor in this the crucible of creation oxford : oxford university press among all species that did not flee the photopic environment in multicellular beings , multicellular eyespots evolved , physically similar to the receptor patches for taste and smell the thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye 's aperture , originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot , allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering , blocked harmful radiation , improved the eye 's refractive index , and allowed functionality outside of water fernald , russell d separation of the forward layer again formed a humour , the aqueous humour this increased refractive power and again eased circulatory problems . relationship to life requirements eyes are generally adapted to the environment and life requirements of the organism which bears them for instance , the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required , with horizon-scanning organisms , such as those that live on the african plains , having a horizontal line of high-density ganglia , while tree-dwelling creatures which require good all-round vision tend to have a symmetrical distribution of ganglia , with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre it is often measured in cycles per degree ( cpd ) , which measures an angular resolution , or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles a rat can resolve only about 1 to 2 cpd most organisms with colour vision can detect ultraviolet light rods can not distinguish colours , but are responsible for low-light ( scotopic ) monochrome ( black-and-white ) vision ; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment , rhodopsin ( visual purple ) , which is sensitive at low light intensity , but saturates at higher ( photopic ) intensities rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina when rods and cones are stimulated by light , they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres there are two types of opsin involved in vision ; c-opsins , which are associated with ciliary-type photoreceptor cells , and r-opsins , associated with rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells the eyes of vertebrates usually contain ciliary cells with c-opsins , and ( bilaterian ) invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with r-opsins c-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes , such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs ; however , the lateral eyes ( which were presumably the ancestral type for this group , if eyes evolved once there ) always use r-opsins cnidaria , which are an outgroup to the taxa mentioned above , express c-opsins—but r-opsins are yet to be found in this group evolution of the eye anatomy of the eye – flash animated interactive ( adobe flash ) webvision the organisation of the retina and visual system
