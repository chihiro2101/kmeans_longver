later made from petroleum , kerosene became a popular lighting fuel a flat-wick lamp is a simple type of kerosene lamp , which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action the glass chimney needs a '' throat '' , or slight constriction , to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel ; the draft carries more air ( oxygen ) past the flame , helping to produce a smokeless light , which is brighter than an open flame would produce the mantle/wick holder has holes around the outer edges this is even more important if using aladdin lamps the lower part of the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene ; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner , which includes a wick-adjustment mechanism mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat-wick lamp , but slower than a center-draught round-wick , as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle , rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself noble lighthouses & keepers : the u.s lighthouse service and its legacy , naval institute press , 2004 , page 34 there are three types : dead-flame , hot-blast , and cold-blast the earliest portable kerosene '' glass globe '' lanterns , of the 1850s and 1860s , were of the dead-flame type , meaning that it had an open wick , but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney '' this improvement essentially redirected wind which might normally tend to extinguish the flame of an unprotected dead-flame lantern , instead is redirected , slowed , pre-heated , and supplied to the burner to actually support and promote the combustion of the fuel a kerosene lamp producing 37 lumens for 4 hours per day consumes about of kerosene per month narasimha desirazu rao distributional impacts of energy policies in india : implications for equity stanford university , 2011 page 36
