insulators must have a high electrical resistance , withstand high temperatures , and be easy to manufacture for a precise fit electrodes in connectors are usually made of copper alloys , due to their good conductivity and malleability the use of a coating material with good conductivity , mechanical robustness and corrosion resistance helps to reduce the influence of passivating oxide layers and surface adsorbates , which limit metal-to-metal contact patches and contribute to contact resistance the majority of connector failures result in intermittent connections or open contacts : normalized failure mode distributions were originally compiled from a combination of : mil-hdbk-978 , “ nasa parts application handbook ” , 1991 ; mil-hdbk-338 , “ electronic reliability design handbook ” , 1994 ; “ reliability toolkit : commercial practices edition '' , reliability analysis center ( rac ) , 1998 ; and “ failure mode , effects , and criticality analysis ( fmeca ) ” , rac , 1993 whilst technically inaccurate , electrical connectors can be viewed as a type of adapter to convert between two connection methods , which are permanently connected at one end and ( usually ) detachable at the other end some of these methods can be accomplished without specialized tools plug and socket connectors are usually made up of a male plug ( typically pin contacts ) and a female socket ( typically receptacle contacts ) according to the asme , the stationary ( more fixed ) connector of a pair is classified as a jack ( denoted j ) , usually attached to a piece of equipment as in a chassis-mount or panel-mount connector rear release contacts are released and removed from the rear ( wire side ) of the connector the removal tool releases the contacts from the rear and pulls the contact out of the retainer solder joints are also more prone to mechanical failure than crimped joints when subjected to vibration and compression since stripping insulation from wires is time-consuming , many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors which cut the insulation as the wire is inserted power conductors carrying more than a few amperes are more reliably terminated with other means , though '' hot tap '' press-on connectors find some use in automotive applications for additions to existing wiring binding posts are a single-wire connection method , where stripped wire is screwed or clamped to a metal electrode the clamping screw may act in the longitudinal axis ( parallel to the wire ) or the transverse axis ( perpendicular to the wire ) , or both another type , often called barrier strips , accepts wires that have ring or spade terminal lugs crimped onto the wires insulated and uninsulated varieties are available they have been commonly used since the 1970s card-edge connectors or fpga mezzanine card twist-on wire connectors ( e.g adapter bent pin analysis cable gland electrical contacts electrical network electrical splice electrical termination gender of connectors and fasteners lightbulb socket pothead for a termination on a high voltage electric power cable tee connector tube socket wire nut
