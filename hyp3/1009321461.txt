saussure 's observations , however , did not achieve any general currency , as they were still too abstract and had little direct evidence to back them up this consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for pie , and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the pie consonant system as it had then been reconstructed the lateness of the discovery of these sounds by indo-europeanists is largely because hittite and the other anatolian languages are the only indo-european languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds when a laryngeal is attested directly , it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant , best exemplified in greek where syllabic laryngeals ( when they appeared next to only consonants ) developed as such : h₁ > e , h₂ > a , and h₃ > o but being reflected , to the exclusion of all other laryngeals , as albanian h when word-initial before an originally stressed vowel encyclopedia of indo-european culture by j mallory , douglas q adams edition : illustrated published by taylor & francis , 1997 , pp lehmann 's view , based on inconsistent reflexes in hittite , that was two separate sounds ) similarly , the traditional pie reconstruction for 'sheep ' is owi- ( a y-stem , not an i-stem ) whence sanskrit ávi- , latin ovis , greek ὄϊς rasmussen ( 1999 ) , p however , winfred p recently , however , simon ( 2010 ) has supported kloekhorst 's thesis by suggesting that plene spelling in cuneiform luwian can be explained in a similar way rasmussen ( 1983 ) suggested a consonantal realization for h₂ as a voiceless velar fricative , with a syllabic allophone , i.e a close-mid central rounded vowel . support for theory from daughter languages later it was noticed that the explanatory power of the theory , as well as its elegance , were enhanced if a third element were added , our h₁ , which has the same lengthening and syllabifying properties as the other two but has no effect on the colour of adjacent vowels most scholars nowadays probably take them as original , but in the case of '' wind '' and '' plow '' , the argument ca n't even come up regarding greek híeros , the pseudo-participle affix -ro- is added directly to the verb root , so - > isero- > ihero- > híeros ( with regular throwback of the aspiration to the beginning of the word ) , and sanskrit iṣirá- indo-european had no roots of the type mem- , tet- , dhredh- , i.e the explanation for the híeros/híaros business has long been discussed , without much result ; laryngeal theory now provides the opportunity for an explanation which did not exist before , namely the metathesis of the two laryngeals : :it seems likely , though it is less certain , that this same -h₁ underlies the nominative-accusative dual in o-stems : sanskrit vṛkā , greek lúkō '' two wolves '' in germany it was roundly rejected the fact that these scholars were engaged in highly speculative long-range linguistic comparison further contributed to its isolation the three-laryngeal system was defended , among others , by walter couvreur and émile benveniste
