side effects of ciclosporin can include gum enlargement , increased hair growth , seizure , peptic ulcers , pancreatitis , fever , vomiting , diarrhea , confusion , hypercholesterolemia , dyspnea , numbness and tingling ( particularly of the lips ) , pruritus , high blood pressure , potassium retention ( possibly leading to hyperkalemia ) , kidney and liver dysfunction , burning sensations at finger tips , and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections ciclosporin 's main effect is to lower the activity of t-cells ; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurinâ€“phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening some sources list the fungus under an alternative species name hypocladium inflatum gams such as pritchard and sneader in 2005 : however , the name , '' beauveria nivea '' , also appears in several other articles including in a 2001 online publication by harriet upton entitled '' origin of drugs in current use : the cyclosporin story '' ( retrieved june 19 , 2005 ) ciclosporin is highly metabolized in humans and animals after ingestion the adenylation domain is responsible for substrate recognition and activation , whereas the thiolation domain covalently binds the adenylated amino acids to phosphopantetheine , and the condensation domain elongates the peptide chain cyclosporin synthetase substrates include l-valine , l-leucine , l-alanine , glycine , 2-aminobutyric acid , 4-methylthreonine , and d-alanine , which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process the racemization of l-ala to d-ala by alanine racemase is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent the formation of butenyl-methyl-l-threonine is performed by a bmt polyketide synthase that uses acetate/malonate as its starting material john wiley & sons , ltd of these 12 genes , sima is the cyclosporin synthetase , simb is the alanine racemase , and simg ( similar to is the polyketide synthase these genes are associated with an active retrotransposon calne and colleagues at the university of cambridge , and in liver transplants performed by thomas starzl at the university of pittsburgh hospital in the united states , the food and drug administration ( fda ) approved ciclosporin for clinical use in 1983 ciclosporin exhibits very poor solubility in water , and , as a consequence , suspension and emulsion forms of the medication have been developed for oral administration and for injection ciclosporin was originally brought to market by sandoz ( now novartis ) , under the brand name sandimmune , which is available as soft gelatin capsules , an oral solution , and a formulation for intravenous administration this multi-center study is being organized by neurovive pharma and the european brain injury consortium using neurovive 's formulation of ciclosporin called neurostat ( also known by its cardioprotection trade name of ciclomulsion ) ciclosporin blocks the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore , which has been found to cause much of the damage associated with head injury and neurodegenerative diseases constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate mptp opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function , leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem inhibition of this pathway has been shown to decrease myocardial hypertrophy
