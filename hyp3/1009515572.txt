this is very uncommon , with about a 1 % prevalence in a 2013 study , 39 % of infants ( 6 to 14 months ) and 97 % of toddlers ( 18 to 24 months ) demonstrated a hand preference for example , if both parents of a child are left-handed , there is a 26 % chance of that child being left-handed two theoretical single-gene models have been proposed to explain the patterns of inheritance of handedness , by marian annett of the university of leicester , and by chris mcmanus of ucl in 2019 , wiberg et al about two-thirds of fetuses present with their left occiput ( back of the head ) at birth in fact , every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either vestibular abnormalities or delay , and asymmetry of the vestibular cortex is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness infants have been observed to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks , especially in one- versus two-handed grasping . correlation with other factors he says that left-handers ' brains are structured in a way that increases their range of abilities , and that the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the brain 's language centers a study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers , even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers , such as violins in two studies , diana deutsch found that left-handers , particularly those with mixed hand preference , performed significantly better than right-handers in musical memory tasks for example : lower-birth-weight and complications at birth are positively correlated with left-handedness another study suggests that the risk of developing multiple sclerosis increases for left-handed women , but the effect is unknown for men at this point left-handers are more likely to suffer bone fractures in a 2006 u.s interactive sports such as table tennis , badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness , while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation other , sports-specific factors may confounding the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations : in cricket , the overall advantage of a bowler 's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone : even disregarding the experience factor ( i.e , right-handed ) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does , because the angle of a bowler 's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman ( see wasim akram ) defensively in baseball , left-handedness is considered an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base , and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder historically , there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base , especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate in handball , left-handed players have an advantage on the right side of the field when attacking , getting a better angle , and that defenders might be unused to them . sexuality and gender identity a 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found '' elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness '' greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among pedophilia . mortality rates in combat a study at durham university — which examined mortality data for cricketers whose handedness was a matter of public record — found that left-handed men were almost twice as likely to die in war as their right-handed contemporaries “ i can sympathise with all those left-handed cricketers who have gone to an early grave trying desperately to shoot straight with a right-handed lee enfield . negative connotations and discrimination the latin adjective sinister or sinistra ( as applied to male or female nouns ⁠— ⁠latin nouns are gender specific ) means '' left '' as well as '' unlucky '' , and this double meaning survives in european derivatives of latin , including the english words '' sinister '' ( meaning both 'evil ' and 'on the bearer 's left on a coat of arms ' ) and '' ambisinister '' meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand ' because writing when moving one 's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing , writing in the latin alphabet might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances к истории латеральной нейропсихологии и нейропсихиатрии it was founded by the left-handers club in 1992 , with the club itself having been founded in 1990 international left-handers day is , according to the club , '' an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality ( left-handedness ) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed '' it celebrates their uniqueness and differences , who are from seven to ten percent of the world 's population again according to the club , '' in the u.k there was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species
