drugs that have been implicated include antiarrhythmic medications such as flecainide , verapamil and propranolol , antidepressants such as amitriptyline , and drugs that enhance vagal tone such as acetylcholine the ecg pattern can also be seen following excessive use of alcohol or cocaine however , a person diagnosed with the condition may be the first in their family to have brugada syndrome if it has arisen as a new mutation the gene in which mutations are most commonly found in brugada syndrome , known as scn5a , is responsible for the cardiac sodium channel however , the genetics of brugada syndrome are complex , and it is likely that the condition results from the interactions of many genes some are responsible for other proteins that form part of the sodium channel , known as sodium channel β subunits ( scn1b , scn2b , scn3b ) while others form different types of sodium channel ( scn10a ) ( gpd1l , pkp2 , mog1 , fgf12 ) brugada syndrome has been described as overlapping with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia ( arvc ) caused by a mutation in the pkp2 gene , causing a brugada ecg pattern but structural changes in the heart characteristic of arvc the genetic variants associated with brs support the concept as scn5a , the gene most commonly associated with the condition , along with scn10a , scn1b , scn2b and scn3b , all directly affect the sodium current i na given the right circumstances , this wavebreak can allow the waves of electricity to perform a u-turn within the muscle , travelling in the reverse direction before beginning to rapidly circle around a point , referred to as re-entry , and causing an abnormal heart rhythm the pattern seen on the ecg includes st elevation in leads v 1 -v 3 with a right bundle branch block ( rbbb ) appearance type 2 has a saddle-back pattern with at least 2 & nbsp ; mm j-point elevation and at least 0.5 & nbsp ; mm elevation of the terminal st segment with a positive or biphasic t-wave a type 3 pattern is relatively common in healthy subjects and is no longer considered suggestive of brugada syndrome however , interpretation of the results of genetic testing is challenging to further complicate matters , many frequently occurring variations in the scn5a gene do not cause any problems , and therefore genetic variants are sometimes identified in persons with brugada syndrome that are not truly causing the disease invasive electrophysiology study , in which wires are passed through a vein to stimulate and record electrical signals from the heart , can sometimes be used to assess the risk of a person with brugada syndrome experiencing dangerous abnormal heart rhythms . file : brugada syndrome type2 example1 ( cardionetworks ecgpedia ) an icd can also function as a pacemaker , preventing abnormally slow heart rates that can also occur in people with brugada syndrome implanting an icd is a relatively low-risk procedure and is frequently performed as a day case under local anesthetic because of the small risk associated with implanting an icd , as well as the cost of the devices , icds are not recommended for all people with brugada syndrome but are instead reserved for people deemed at higher risk of sudden cardiac death in this procedure , wires are passed through a vein in the leg into the heart , or through a small hole underneath the sternum type 1 brugada ecg patterns are seen more frequently in asian populations ( 0 % –0.36 % ) than those in europe ( 0 % –0.25 % ) and the united states ( 0.03 % ) '' season 4 , episode : 24 '' unsolved mysteries : original robert stack episodes cosgrove/meurer productions , apr
