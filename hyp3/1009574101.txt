image : fastrak transponder.jpg right frame fastrak , an rfid tag used for electronic toll collection in california in 1945 , l√©on theremin invented a listening device for the soviet union which retransmitted incident radio waves with the added audio information transponders are still used by most powered aircraft rfid tags are made out of three pieces : a micro chip ( an integrated circuit which stores and processes information and modulates and demodulates radio-frequency ( rf ) signals ) , an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal and a substrate the tag information is stored in a non-volatile memory this makes a difference in interference and in exposure to radiation tags may either be read-only , having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database , or may be read/write , where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user a passive reader active tag ( prat ) system has a passive reader which only receives radio signals from active tags ( battery operated , transmit only ) this allows a highly defined reading area for when tags go in and out of the interrogation zone mobile readers may be handheld or mounted on carts or vehicles uhf rfid tags that comply with the epc2 gen 2 class 1 standard usually support this mechanism , while protecting the chip from being killed with a password the maximum shear force for each joint , which finally separates the chip from the substrate , is recorded , as shown in fig.1 ( c )
