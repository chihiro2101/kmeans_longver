the main functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation the popular satellite error correction codes include : convolutional codes : with constraint length less than 10 , usually decoded using a viterbi algorithm ( see viterbi decoder ) ; with constraint length more than 10 , usually decoded using a fano algorithm ( see sequential decoder ) ; reed-solomon codes usually concatenated with convolutional codes with an interleaving ; new modems support superior error correction codes ( turbo codes and ldpc codes ) frame formats that are supported by various satellite modems include : intelsat business service ( ibs ) framing intermediate data rate ( idr ) framing mpeg-2 transport framing ( used in dvb ) e1 and t1 framing high-end modems also incorporate some additional features : multiple data interfaces ( like rs-232 , rs-422 , v.35 , g.703 , lvds , ethernet ) ; embedded distant-end monitor and control ( edmac ) , allowing to control the distant-end modem ; automatic uplink power control ( aupc ) , that is , adjusting the output power to maintain a constant signal to noise ratio at the remote end ; drop and insert feature for a multiplexed stream , allowing to replace some channels in it then its frequency is converted if needed a digital modulator transforms a digital stream into a radio signal on intermediate frequency ( if ) the exact structure of the demodulator is defined by a modulation type digital demodulation implies that a symbol clock ( and , in most cases , an intermediate frequency generator ) at the receiving side have to be synchronous with those at the transmitting side error correction works by adding an artificial redundancy to a data stream at the transmitting side , and using this redundancy to correct errors caused by noise and interference there are several modulation types ( such as psk and qam ) that have a phase ambiguity , that is , a carrier can be restored in different ways when differential coding is used , the data are deliberately made to depend not only on the current symbol , but also on the previous one there are two different types , both employing the digital video broadcasting ( dvb ) standard as their basis : one-way satmodems ( dvb-ip modems ) use a return channel not based on communication with the satellite , such as telephone or cable dvb-rcs is etsi standard en 301 790
