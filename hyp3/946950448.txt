after much experimentation it was found that adding pewterer 's tin , obtained from cassiterite , improved the ability of the cast type to withstand the wear and tear of the printing process , making it tougher but not more brittle despite patiently trying different proportions of both metals , solving the second part of the type metal problem proved very difficult without the addition of yet a third metal , antimony the typefounder would typically introduce powdered stibnite and horseshoe nails into his crucible to melt lead , tin and antimony into type metal it is harder , stiffer and tougher than lead antimony ( sb ) is a metalloid element , which melts at after stirring the molten metal , grey powder forms on the surface , the dross , needing to be skimmed general requirements for type-metal type metal should be easy to cast , this means : a reasonable low melting point , iron should not dissolve in the molten metal , mould and nozzles should stay clean and easy to maintain behaviour of bipolar alloys this is not the case with alloys the addition of a small amount of antimony ( 5 % to 6 % ) to lead will significantly alter the alloy 's behavior compared to pure lead : although the melting point of pure antimony is 630 & nbsp ; °c , this mixture will be completely molten and a homogeneous fluid even at temperatures as low as 371 & nbsp ; °c at 252 & nbsp ; °c , the mixture will start to fully solidify , during which the temperature will remain constant raising the content of antimony can not be done without adding some tin too alloys used on monotype machines tend to contain higher contents of tin , to obtain tougher character present usage of type metal since a monotype composition caster can cope with a variety of different metal alloys , occasional mixing of linotype alloy with discarded typefounders alloy has proven its usefulness contamination of type metals copper has been used for hardening type metal ; this metal easily forms mixed crystals with tin when the alloy cools down historic references to type metals joseph moxon , mechanick exercises , page 164 , sect xviii , reprint of the 1896-edition , thoemmes press , bristol , uk the typecasters , ellic howe in : the monotype-recorder , vol
