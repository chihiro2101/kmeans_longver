logistics engineering as a discipline is a very important aspect of systems engineering that also includes reliability engineering if a subsystem is only 50 % reliable , one can concentrate on improving the reliability of that subsystem , design in multiple subsystems in parallel ( 5 in this case would achieve approximately 97 % reliability of that subsystem ) , purchase and store spare subsystems for rapid change out , establish repair capability that would get a failed subsystem back in operation in the required amount of time , and/or choose any combination of those approaches to achieve the optimal cost vs then the engineer moves onto the next subsystem the various fields and topics that logistics engineers are involved with include : customer service : provision of services to customers before , during and after a purchase purchasing : acquiring goods or services to accomplish its goals sourcing : procurement practices , aimed at finding , evaluating and engaging suppliers for acquiring goods and services demand forecasting : the art and science of forecasting customer demand to drive holistic execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management facility location : the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing , and competitors ' facilities layout design inventory control : the activity of checking a shop ’ s stock material handling : short-distance movement within the confines of a building or between a building and a transportation vehicle warehousing distribution system design reliability engineering : sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product reverse logistics : the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value , or proper disposal green logistics : attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities intermodal transport supportability analysis the landed cost is the total cost of purchasing , transporting , warehousing and distributing raw materials , semi-finished and finished goods another performance metric equally important is the end customer fill rate the following institutions provide logistics engineering programs around the world : florida international university - master of science in logistics engineering aston university – bsc logistics with supply chain management aston bsc logistics with supply chain management breda university of applied sciences – bachelor of science in international logistics engineering beijing jiaotong university – bachelor of engineering in logistic engineering ohio state university – master of business logistics engineering fisher college of business mble program university of hong kong – bachelor of engineering in logistics engineering and supply chain management hong kong logistics programs hong kong polytechnic university – bachelor of science in logistics engineering and management university of science and technology beijing – bachelors , masters and ph.d programs in logistics engineering dalian maritime university – masters program in logistics engineering & management shanghai maritime university – bachelors & doctoral programs in logistics engineering south china university of technology – masters and ph.d
