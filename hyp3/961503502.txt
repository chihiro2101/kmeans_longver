although these relational concepts are mathematically defined , those definitions map loosely to traditional database concepts an example would be ( name : '' harry '' , age : 25 ) the latter requirement simply says that all the tuples in a relation should contain the same column names , namely those defined for it in the schema the formulas are defined given a database schema s ( d , r , h ) and a partial function type : v ⇸ 2 c , called at type assignment , that assigns headers to some tuple variables the formal semantics of such atoms is defined given a database db over s and a tuple variable binding val : v → t d that maps tuple variables to tuples over the domain in s : v.a w.b is true if and only if val ( v ) ( a ) val ( w ) ( b ) v.a k is true if and only if val ( v ) ( a ) k r ( v ) is true if and only if val ( v ) is in db ( r )
