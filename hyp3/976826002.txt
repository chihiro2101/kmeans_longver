these groups appeared in the theory of quadratic forms : in the case of binary integral quadratic forms , as put into something like a final form by gauss , a composition law was defined on certain equivalence classes of forms later kummer was working towards a theory of cyclotomic fields the principal ideals form the ideal class r which serves as an identity element for this multiplication however , if r is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field , or more generally a dedekind domain , the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group , the ideal class group of r the group property of existence of inverse elements follows easily from the fact that , in a dedekind domain , every non-zero ideal ( except r ) is a product of prime ideals in general the bound is not sharp enough to make the calculation practical for fields with large discriminant , but computers are well suited to the task the mapping from rings of integers r to their corresponding class groups is functorial , and the class group can be subsumed under the heading of algebraic k-theory , with k 0 ( r ) being the functor assigning to r its ideal class group ; more precisely , k 0 ( r ) z & times ; c ( r ) , where c ( r ) is the class group relation with the group of units the rings z , eisenstein integers zω , and gaussian integers zi , where ω is a cube root of 1 and i is a fourth root of 1 ( i.e if k is a field , then the polynomial ring kx 1 , x 2 , x 3 , is an integral domain if d is a square-free integer ( a product of distinct primes ) other than 1 , then q is a quadratic field if d 0 , then it is unknown whether there are infinitely many fields q with class number 1 for d 0 , the ideal class group may be half the size since the class group of integral binary quadratic forms is isomorphic to the narrow class group of q
