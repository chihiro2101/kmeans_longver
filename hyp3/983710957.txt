the graph analysis could also limit measure integration at radius ' n ' , for segments further than this radius not to be taken into account each time an intersection appears , the remaining value of flow is divided equally amongst the splitting streets , until all the other street segments in the graph are reached when the same procedure has been conducted using each segment as a starting point for the initial value of one , a graph of final values appears like integration , choice analysis can be restricted to limited local radii , for instance 400m , 800m , 1600m space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets , but , strictly speaking , choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street depth distance is the most intuitive of the analysis methods many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice space syntax limited , which was founded at the bartlett , university college london in 1989 this paradox was proposed by carlo ratti at the massachusetts institute of technology , but comprehensively refuted in a passionate academic exchange with bill hillier and alan penn 2004 there have been moves to combine space syntax with more traditional transport engineering models , using intersections as nodes and constructing visibility graphs to link them , by researchers including bin jiang , valerio cutini and michael batty recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in gis , such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group spatial analysis and design at the royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden
