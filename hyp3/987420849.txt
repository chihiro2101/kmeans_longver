occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process image : silicon grown by czochralski process 1956.jpg thumb 240px silicon crystal being grown by the czochralski method at raytheon , 1956 doubts over 450mm and euv the shaft rotates counterclockwise and the crucible rotates clockwise the boule can be from one to two metres , depending on the amount of silicon in the crucible additionally , oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing cern rd50 status report 2004 , cern-lhcc-2004-031 and lhcc-rd-005 and cited literature therein it has also been shown that the presence of oxygen in silicon increases impurity trapping during post-implantation annealing processes plummer , michael d deal , and peter b 126â€“27 consider the following : di -k_o c_l dv\ ; : di - k_o \frac : f v_s / v_o\ ;
