schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres ( both myelinated and unmyelinated ) alive the sheath is not continuous during peripheral nerve regeneration , 9-o-acetyl gd3 is expressed by schwann cells the action potential jumps from node to node , in a process called saltatory conduction , which can increase conduction velocity up to 10 times , without an increase in axonal diameter kalat , james w physiology of behavior , 9th ed usa : pearson education , inc it is found in the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons at the point in time that schwann cell precursors begin to populate spinal nerves and therefore influences schwann cell survival myelin protein zero ( p0 ) is a cell-adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is the major component of peripheral myelin , constituting over 50 % of the total protein in the sheath although myelination of large caliber axons was initiated in p0- mice , the resulting myelin layers were very thin and poorly compacted unexpectedly , p0- mice also showed degeneration of both axons and their surround myelin sheaths , suggesting that p0 plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of both myelin formation and the axon with which it ’ s associated one indispensable transcription factor expressed during the myelination process is krox-20 indeed , in these mice , the schwann cells are not able to perform their myelination properly as they only wrap their cytoplasmic processes one and half turn around the axon and despite the fact that they still express the early myelin marker , late myelin gene products are absent charcot–marie–tooth disease ( cmt ) , guillain–barré syndrome ( gbs , acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy type ) , schwannomatosis , and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( cidp ) , leprosy , and zika virus are all neuropathies involving schwann cells
