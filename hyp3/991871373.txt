pressing the string against the fret reduces the vibrating length of the string to that between the bridge and the next fret between the fretting finger and the bridge this is damped if the string were stopped with the soft fingertip on a fretless fingerboard fan frets ( also fanned frets , slanted frets ) , or multi-scale : while frets are generally perpendicular to the instrument 's neck centerline and parallel to each other , on a '' fanned '' fretboard , the frets are angled ( spread like a fan ) with only one center fret perpendicular to the neck ’ s centerline this gives the lower-pitched strings more length and the higher strings shorter length ( comparable to a piano or a harp where heavier strings have different lengths ) fat frets : on older guitars ( especially the fender stratocaster ) , frets were typically made out of thin wire , and some electric guitar players replaced that with thicker wire , for '' fat frets '' or '' jumbo frets '' semi-fretted versions of guitars and other fretted string instruments , however , are usually one-off , custom adaptations made for players who want to combine elements of both types of sound when the saddle is positioned properly , however , the fretted tones all sound sharp to the same degree as long as the distances between the frets are correct when this happens , the instrument may need refretting ( the frets are removed and replaced ) or , in less severe cases , '' fret dressing '' ( the frets are leveled , polished , and possibly recrowned ) fret buzz can be caused by different things : low action improperly installed frets strings too loose improper relief of guitar neck fret buzz is evident in some famous recordings ; an example is '' friends '' by led zeppelin ( although this example is undoubtedly caused by alternate open tunings that reduce string tension ) konrad schwingenstein : intonation of stringed instruments with straight frets , calculating fret positions – an article on calculating fret positions for any equal tempered instrument on the liutaio mottola lutherie information website how to replace frets – photo story installing the frets in a fretted stringed musical instrument an article on fret installation for a new instrument on the liutaio mottola lutherie information website
