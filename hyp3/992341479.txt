in this case , k 1 for example , a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 ( 235 u ) with a mass of about would experience around 15 & nbsp ; spontaneous fission events per second fission can also be initiated by neutrons produced by cosmic rays if the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass , to create a barely supercritical mass , the temperature of the assembly would increase to an initial maximum ( for example : 1 & nbsp ; k above the ambient temperature ) and then decrease back to the ambient temperature after a period of time , because fuel consumed during fission brings the assembly back to subcriticality once again neglecting the very important resonances , the total neutron cross-section of every material exhibits an inverse relationship with relative neutron velocity varying the density of the mass using such a material as fuel means fission decreases as the fuel temperature increases use of a neutron reflector use of a tamper this increases the efficiency the critical size is the minimum size of a nuclear reactor core or nuclear weapon that can be made for a specific geometrical arrangement and material composition note that not all neutrons contribute to the chain reaction then , criticality occurs when ν·q 1 given a total interaction cross section σ ( typically measured in barns ) , the mean free path of a prompt neutron is \ell^ \sigma where the factor f has been rewritten as f to account for the fact that the two values may differ depending upon geometrical effects and how one defines σ this is applied in implosion-type nuclear weapons where a spherical mass of fissile material that is substantially less than a critical mass is made supercritical by very rapidly increasing ρ ( and thus σ as well ) ( see below ) consider diesel fumes belched from an exhaust pipe this reduces it to a diffusion problem for any finite thickness , this corresponds to an infinite mass in the case of a uranium bomb , this can be achieved by keeping the fuel in a number of separate pieces , each below the critical size either because they are too small or unfavorably shaped this design is referred to as a gun-type fission weapon the event of fission must release , on the average , more than one free neutron of the desired energy level in order to sustain a chain reaction , and each must find other nuclei and cause them to fission criticality accident nuclear criticality safety geometric and material buckling
