smaller power hammers , or less reciprocating weight , and hydraulic presses are common in art smithies as well additionally , forgings can achieve a lower total cost than casting or fabrication image : forgedconrodshowingetchedsection-s.jpg thumb upright a cross-section of a forged connecting rod that has been etched to show the grain flow there are many different kinds of forging processes available ; however , they can be grouped into three main classes : drawn out : length increases , cross-section decreases upset : length decreases , cross-section increases squeezed in closed compression dies : produces multidirectional flow common forging processes include : roll forging , swage , cogging , open-die forging , impression-die forging ( close die forging ) , press forging , cold forging automatic hot forging and upsetting the operator therefore needs to orient and position the workpiece to get the desired shape the dies are usually flat in shape , but some have a specially shaped surface for specialized operations advantages of open-die forging reduced chance of voids better fatigue resistance improved microstructure continuous grain flow finer grain size greater strength better response to thermal treatment improvement of internal quality greater reliability of mechanical properties , ductility and impact resistance '' '' is the successive deformation of a bar along its length using an open-die drop forge once the proper thickness is achieved the proper width is achieved via '' edging '' '' '' is a similar process that thins out sections of the forging using a convex shaped die file : forging-edging.svg edging file : forging-fullering.svg fullering the hammer is generally in contact with the workpiece on the scale of milliseconds excess metal is squeezed out of the die cavities , forming what is referred to as '' flash '' these stages usually impart the workpiece with generous bends and large fillets if there is only a short run of parts to be done , then it may be more economical for the die to lack a final impression cavity and instead machine the final features 393 one variation of impression-die forging is called '' flashless forging '' , or '' true closed-die forging '' closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities . design of impression-die forgings and tooling adequate draft is provided ; usually at least 3° for aluminium and 5° to 7° for steel ribs are low and wide casting cold sizing hammerscale thixoforming forging temperature : handbuch umformtechnik : grundlagen , technologien , maschinen ( in german ) , 2nd edition , springer verlag , 2010 , ostermann , f
