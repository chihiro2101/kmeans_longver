the force sensor is usually a micrometre-sized bead or a cantilever , whose displacement can be measured to determine the force molecules adsorbed on a surface are picked up by a microscopic tip ( nanometres wide ) that is located on the end of an elastic cantilever in general the rupture of a tip-surface bond is a stochastic process ; therefore reliable quantification of the adhesion force requires taking multiple individual force curves for example , ma x , utilized dynamic force spectroscopy along with molecular dynamics simulations to find out the binding force between thrombin , a blood coagulation protein , and its dna aptamer in this technique , a piezo element resonantly excites planar acoustic waves over a microfluidic chip until then experiments had been carried out using oppositely directed lasers as a means to trap particles later experiments , at the same project at bell laboratories and others since , showed damage-free manipulation on cells using an infrared laser afs devices allow the statistical analysis of the mechanical properties of biological systems by applying piconewton forces to hundreds of individual particles in parallel , with sub-millisecond response time the sequential unfolding of modules is observed as a very characteristic sawtooth pattern of the force vs elongation graph ; every tooth corresponds to the unfolding of a single protein module ( apart from the last that is generally the detachment of the protein molecule from the tip ) many proteins in the living cell must face mechanical stress low temperatures and high pulling speeds correspond to higher breaking forces science ( washington , d.c
