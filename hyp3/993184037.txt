( the before inherited batibus communication medium ( tp0 ) is no longer part of the knx specifications ) radio ( knx-rf ) ip ( also referred to as eibnet/ip or knxnet/ip ) knx is not based on a specific hardware platform and a network can be controlled by anything from an 8-bit microcontroller to a pc , according to the demands of a particular building the knx association had 443 registered hardware and software vendor members from 44 nations as at 1 july 2018 line couplers , backbone couplers ) the key features of the knx architecture are : interworking and distributed application models for the building automation various tasks ; schemes for configuration and management of resources on the network , and to permit the binding of parts of a distributed application in different nodes ; a communication system with a message protocol and models for the communication stack in each node ( capable of hosting distributed applications ( knx common kernel ) ; and models for the realization of these elements when developing actual devices to be mounted and linked in an installation common kernel and message protocol it is osi 7-layer model compliant : a general data link layer , which sits above the specific data link layers for each medium , provides access control and the logical link control ; a network layer ( for nodes with routing functionality ) provides a segment-wise acknowledged telegram ( frame ) and controls the hop count of a frame ; a transport layer enables four types of communication : one-to-many connectionless ( multicast ) , one-to-all connectionless ( broadcast ) , one-to-one connectionless , one-to-one connection-oriented ; ( osi session and presentation layers are empty ) ; and an application layer offers a toolkit of services to the application process binding and parameter setting configuration may be achieved through a combination of local activity on the devices ( such pushing a button ) , and active network management communication over the bus ( peer-to-peer , or more centralized master-slave ) logical topology and individual address space ) segments connected with line repeater can extend to a length of 4000 m and link up to 256 devices an installation based on knxnet/ip allows the integration of knx sub networks via ip as the knx address structure is similar to an ip address media access control is via csma/ca selv power is distributed via the same pair for low-power devices frame ( telegram ) overview
