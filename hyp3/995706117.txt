the russell–saunders term symbol of the ground state in all elements in the group is 4 s when oxidized or ionized , pnictogens typically take an oxidation state of +3 ( by losing all three p-shell electrons in the valence shell ) or +5 ( by losing all three p-shell and both s-shell electrons in the valence shell ) however heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabilized boudreaux , kevin a department of chemistry , angelo state university , texas ) crystal solids featuring pnictogens fully reduced include yttrium nitride , calcium phosphide , sodium arsenide , indium antimonide , and even double salts like aluminum gallium indium phosphide phosphorus forms a +iii oxide which is stable at room temperature , phosphorous acid , and several trihalides , although the triiodide is unstable moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides , of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water the '' true '' +5 state is more common for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony , as shown in their oxides , phosphorus ( v ) oxide , arsenic ( v ) oxide , and antimony ( v ) oxide , and their fluorides , phosphorus ( v ) fluoride , arsenic ( v ) fluoride , antimony ( v ) fluoride likewise , diimide , which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other , and diazene have nitrogen in the oxidation state of −1 the pnictogens consist of two non-metals ( one gas , one solid ) , two metalloids , one metal , and one element with unknown chemical properties nitrogen and bismuth , despite both being pnictogens , are very different in their physical properties phosphorus 's density is 1.82 g/cm 3 at stp , arsenic 's is 5.72 g/cm 3 , antimony 's is 6.68 g/cm 3 , and bismuth 's is 9.79 g/cm 3 nitrogen 's melting point is −210 & nbsp ; °c and its boiling point is −196 & nbsp ; °c arsenic is one of only two elements to sublimate at standard pressure ; it does this at 603 & nbsp ; °c nitrogen 's crystal structure is hexagonal in the 1760s two scientists , henry cavendish and joseph priestley , isolated nitrogen from air , but neither realized the presence of an undiscovered element brandt produced the element by heating evaporated urine and condensing the resulting phosphorus vapor in water the antimony mineral stibnite may have been a component of greek fire bismuth was first discovered by an alchemist in 1400 the term '' pnictogen '' was suggested by the dutch chemist anton eduard van arkel in the early 1950s nitrogen makes up 2.5 % of a typical human by weight arsenic makes up 1.5 parts per million of the earth 's crust , making it the 53rd most abundant element there some arsenic exists in elemental form , but most arsenic is found in the arsenic minerals orpiment , realgar , arsenopyrite , and enargite '' arsenic ( as ) chemical element '' if an oxide ore of antimony contains less than 30 % antimony by weight , the ore is reduced in a blast furnace united states geological survey moscovium is produced a few atoms at a time in particle accelerators by firing a beam of calcium-48 ions at americium until the nuclei fuse phosphorus is used in matches and incendiary bombs this is seen in leguminous plants such as peas or spinach and lettuce phosphorus in the form of phosphates occur in compounds important to life , such as dna and atp there are approximately 2 mg of antimony in a typical 70 kg human bismuth is not known to have a biological role humans ingest on average less than 20 μg of bismuth per day the build-up of nitrogen bubbles in the blood , such as those that may occur during scuba diving , can cause a condition known as the '' bends '' ( decompression sickness ) white phosphorus , an allotrope of phosphorus , is toxic , with 1 mg per kg bodyweight being a lethal dose white phosphorus usually kills humans within a week of ingestion by attacking the liver oxypnictide , including superconductors discovered in 2008
