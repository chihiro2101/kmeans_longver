he had an older sister , paula , who became a doctor , and two older brothers , david and william , who became lawyers he was an eagle scout '' reines sang in a chorus , and as a soloist the family later moved to north bergen , new jersey , residing on kennedy boulevard and 57th street from an early age , reines exhibited an interest in science , and liked creating and building things he married sylvia samuels on august 30 , 1940 present on '' nuclear fission and the liquid drop model of the nucleus '' in 1944 richard feynman recruited reines to work in the theoretical division at the manhattan project 's los alamos laboratory , where he would remain for the next fifteen years diffusion was an important aspect of critical mass calculations an outgrowth of the '' demon core second incident '' experiment , the dragon was a machine that could attain a critical state for short bursts of time , which could be used as a research tool or power source enrico fermi renamed it the neutrino , italian for '' little neutral one '' , and in 1934 , proposed his fermi 's interaction by which the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton , an electron , and a neutrino : : → + + the neutrino accounted for the missing energy , but fermi 's theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that appeared to be impossible to observe directly '' so why did we want to detect the free neutrino ? '' he later explained , '' because everybody said , you could n't do it in 1966 , reines took most of his neutrino research team with him when he left for the new university of california , irvine ( uci ) , becoming its first dean of physical sciences supernova explosions are rare , but reines thought he might be lucky enough to see one in his lifetime , and be able to catch the neutrinos streaming from it in his specially-designed detectors the supernova registered 19 events in just ten seconds this discovery is regarded as inaugurating the field of neutrino astronomy robert oppenheimer memorial prize in 1981 , the national medal of science in 1985 , the bruno rossi prize in 1989 , the michelson–morley award in 1990 , the panofsky prize in 1992 , and the franklin medal in 1992 measurement of the free antineutrino absorption cross section expected cross section from measurements of fission fragment electron spectrum '' , los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) ( through predecessor agency los alamos scientific laboratory ) , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( june 1958 )
