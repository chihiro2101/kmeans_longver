'' from the english translation by m as a nowadays common interpretation , a positive solution to hilbert 's second question would in particular provide a proof that peano arithmetic is consistent gödel 's incompleteness theorem gödel 's second incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible for any proof that peano arithmetic is consistent to be carried out within peano arithmetic itself the method used in this proof can also be used to prove a cut elimination result for peano arithmetic in a stronger logic than first-order logic , but the consistency proof itself can be carried out in ordinary first-order logic using the axioms of primitive recursive arithmetic and a transfinite induction principle kreisel ( 1976 ) states that although gödel 's results imply that no finitistic syntactic consistency proof can be obtained , semantic ( in particular , second-order ) arguments can be used to give convincing consistency proofs detlefsen ( 1990 : p dawson ( 2006 : sec '' die widerspruchsfreiheit der reinen zahlentheorie & nbsp ; 493 & ndash ; 565 archiv der mathematik und physik , v english translation , maby winton , bulletin of the american mathematical society 8 ( 1902 ) , 437 & ndash ; 479 nagel , ernest and newman , james r , godel 's proof , new york university press , 1958 144 , footnote 7 ) -- >
