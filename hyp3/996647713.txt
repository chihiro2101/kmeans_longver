johann bernoulli ( june 1696 ) '' problema novum ad cujus solutionem mathematici invitantur '' ( given in a vertical plane two points a and b ( see figure 5 ) , assign to the moving body m , the path amb , by means of which — descending by its own weight and beginning to be moved by gravity from point a — it would arrive at the other point b in the shortest time ) solutions to johann bernoulli 's problem of 1696 : isaac newton ( january 1697 ) '' de ratione temporis quo grave labitur per rectam data duo puncta conjungentem , ad tempus brevissimum quo , vi gravitatis , transit ab horum uno ad alterum per arcum cycloidis '' ( on a proof that the time in which a weight slides by a line joining two given points is the shortest in terms of time when it passes , via gravitational force , from one of these points to the other through a cycloidal arc ) , philosophical transactions of the royal society of london , 19 : 424-425 bernoullio geometris publice propositi , una cum solutione sua problematis alterius ab eodem postea propositi ) , acta eruditorum , 19 : 206–211 after deriving the differential equation for the curve by the method given below , he went on to show that it does yield a cycloid tom whiteside , newton the mathematician , in bechler , contemporary newtonian research , p '' , and newton had already solved newton 's minimal resistance problem , which is considered the first of the kind in calculus of variations in the end , five mathematicians responded with solutions : newton , jakob bernoulli , gottfried leibniz , ehrenfried walther von tschirnhaus and guillaume de l'hôpital four of the solutions ( excluding l'hôpital 's ) were published in the same edition of the journal as johann bernoulli 's in this dialogue galileo reviews his own work in a letter to henri basnage , held at the university of basel public library , dated 30 march 1697 , johann bernoulli stated that he had found two methods ( always referred to as '' direct '' and '' indirect '' ) to show that the brachistochrone was the '' common cycloid '' , also called the '' roulette '' he wrote that this was partly because he believed it was sufficient to convince anyone who doubted the conclusion , partly because it also resolved two famous problems in optics which '' the late mr mémoires de l'académie des sciences ( french academy of sciences ) vol 135–138 the early period of the calculus of variations , by p he defines m so that md mx , and n so that mm nx + na and notes that x is the only variable and that m is finite and n is infinitely small
