the conjunction aspect ( essentially 0° , discounting orb ) can be in either category , depending on which two planets it is that are conjunct it is important to note that different astrologers and separate astrological systems/traditional utilize differing orbs ( the degree of separation between exactitude ) when calculating and using the aspects , though almost all use a larger orb for a conjunction when compared to the other aspects conjunctions are said to be the most powerful aspect , mutually intensifying the effects of the planets involved ; they are major point in an individual 's chart a planet in very close conjunction to the sun ( within 17 minutes of arc , or only about 0.28° ) is said to be cazimi , an ancient astrological term meaning '' in the heart '' ( of the sun ) in the case of combust , specific orb limit will depend on the particular planet in conjunction with the sun bridges , oxford : clarendon press , 1897 , vol or pierre d'ailly , de concordia astronomice veritatis et narrationis historice ( 1414 ) and they are mentioned in popular and literary writing by authors such as dante woody k 2 ( summer , 1970 ) , pp if and designate the periods of jupiter and saturn then the return takes 1/ ( 5/s-2/j ) which comes to 883.15 years , but to be a whole number of conjunction intervals it must be sometimes 913 years and sometimes 854 particular importance has been accorded to the occurrence of a great conjunction in a new trigon , which is bound to happen after some 240 years at most left a sextile ( abrv left a trine ( abbrev left an opposition ( abrv all important axes in astrology are essentially oppositions its interpretation will rely mostly on the houses , planets , and signs involved the effect will involve different areas of life being brought together that are not usually in communication since the planets are far enough apart to be in different house quadrants , like the trine , but often with a shift in perspective involving others not previously seen clearly an orb of ±1.2° is allowed a semi-square is an angle of 45° ( 1/8 of the 360° ecliptic ) for example , if the sun is posited in 10° aquarius and venus is posited in 25° pisces then a semi-square would occur it indicates an energy of perfection and/or idealization it represents an opportunity for perspective and communication between energies that requires some work to be made conscious contraparallel : opposite degree± 1-degree 12-minute of arc the classical origin & traditional use of aspects deborah houlding online ephemeris from khaldea.com—600bc to 2400ad—calculated for midnight gmt ; also with an aspectarian included for years 1900 to 2005
