early advertising called the new invention the '' girl-less , cuss-less , out-of-order-less , wait-less telephone '' rochester 's remarkable past by donovan a strowger sold his patents in 1896 for us 1,800 and sold his share in automatic electric in 1898 for us 10,000 the upper one has ten grooves , and raises the shaft an interlock ensures that the spring on the shaft rotates it to angular home position before it drops to its home position by gravity the commercial version of the strowger switch , as developed by the strowger automatic telephone exchange company , used a rotary dial for signalling to the exchange instead of dedicating an expensive first-stage selector switch to each customer as in the first exchange , the customer was given access to the first-stage switch of a telephone network , often by a line-finder which searches '' backward '' for the calling line ; so requiring only a few relays ( in most cases two , a line , and a cut-off relay ) , for the equipment required for each customer line later strowger ( sxs ) exchanges often use a subscriber uniselector as part of the line equipment individual to each line , which searches '' forward '' for a first selector the selection of switching systems for london and other large cities was not decided until the 1920s , when the director telephone system was adopted the director systems used sxs switches for destination routing and number translation facilities similar to the register used in common-control exchanges
