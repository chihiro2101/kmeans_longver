for instance , the word screwdriver used in the previous example refers to screwdriver , and not to screwdriver ( cocktail ) a word can be both a hypernym and a hyponym : for example purple is a hyponym of color but itself is a hypernym of the broad spectrum of shades of purple between the range of crimson and violet if the hypernym z consists of hyponyms x and y , x and y are identified as co-hyponyms however , an apple is not a peach , which is also not a plum thus , they are incompatible horn called this '' licensed polysemy '' , but found that autohyponyms also formed even when there is no other hyponym the hypernym '' smell '' ( to emit any smell ) has a hyponym '' stink '' ( to emit a bad smell ) , but is autohyponymous because '' smell '' can also mean '' to emit a bad smell '' , even though there is no '' to emit a smell that is n't bad '' hyponym in other combinations with this stem , e.g synonym , it is never elided hyperonymy is used , for instance , by john lyons , who does not mention hypernymy and prefers superordination 291 the nominalization hyperonymy is rarely used , because the neutral term to refer to the relationship is hyponymy this would be difficult , because abstract information ( such as the speakers ' relative ages ) is often not available during machine translation .
