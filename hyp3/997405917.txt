supergiant spectra are frequently annotated to indicate spectral peculiarities , for example rigel or f5 ipec stars with initial masses above quickly and smoothly initiate helium core fusion after they have exhausted their hydrogen , and continue fusing heavier elements after helium exhaustion until they develop an iron core , at which point the core collapses to produce a type 2 supernova there are several categories of evolved stars that are not supergiants in evolutionary terms but may show supergiant spectral features or have luminosities comparable to supergiants δ cephei itself is an example with a luminosity of and a mass of they have spectra dominated by helium and other heavier elements , usually showing little or no hydrogen , which is a clue to their nature as stars even more evolved than supergiants supergiants have masses from 8 to 12 times the sun upwards , and luminosity from about 1,000 to over a million times the sun the stefan-boltzmann law dictates that the relatively cool surfaces of red supergiants radiate much less energy per unit area than those of blue supergiants ; thus , for a given luminosity , red supergiants are larger than their blue counterparts the supergiant luminosity class is assigned on the basis of spectral features that are largely a measure of surface gravity , although such stars are also affected by other properties such as microturbulence although supergiants exist in every class from o to m , the majority are spectral type b , more than at all other spectral classes combined the bolometric luminosity of a star reflects its total output of electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths a b0 main sequence star has an absolute magnitude of about & minus ; 5 , meaning that all b0 supergiants are significantly brighter than absolute magnitude & minus ; 5 o2 if for hd 93129a ) yellow supergiants can be considerably fainter than absolute magnitude & minus ; 5 , with some examples around & minus ; 2 ( e.g these are not massive stars , though ; instead , they are stars of intermediate mass that have particularly low surface gravities , often due to instability such as cepheid pulsations the majority of agb stars are given giant or bright giant luminosity classes , but particularly unstable stars such as w virginis variables may be given a supergiant classification ( e.g while most supergiants such as alpha cygni variables , semiregular variables , and irregular variables show some degree of photometric variability , certain types of variables amongst the supergiants are well defined they are usually supergiants or hypergiants , occasionally with wolf-rayet spectra—extremely luminous , massive , evolved stars with expanded outer layers , but they are so distinctive and unusual that they are often treated as a separate category without being referred to as supergiants or given a supergiant spectral type helium is formed in the core and shell by fusion of hydrogen and nitrogen which accumulates relative to carbon and oxygen during cno cycle fusion red supergiants can be distinguished from luminous but less massive agb stars by unusual chemicals at the surface , enhancement of carbon from deep third dredge-ups , as well as carbon-13 , lithium and s-process elements hotter supergiants show differing levels of nitrogen enrichment this may be due to different levels of mixing on the main sequence due to rotation or because some blue supergiants are newly evolved from the main sequence while others have previously been through a red supergiant phase due to their extreme masses , they have short lifespans , between 30 & nbsp ; million years and a few hundred thousand years they continue to fuse hydrogen until it is almost entirely depleted throughout the star , then rapidly evolve through a series of stages of similarly hot and luminous stars : supergiants , slash stars , wnh- , wn- , and possibly wc- or wo-type stars most type ii supernova progenitors are thought to be red supergiants , while the less common type ib/c supernovae are produced by hotter wolf–rayet stars that have completely lost more of their hydrogen atmosphere stars large enough to start fusing elements heavier than helium do not seem to have any way to lose enough mass to avoid catastrophic core collapse , although some may collapse , almost without trace , into their own central black holes the progenitor for the unusual type ii supernova 1987a was a blue supergiant , thought to have already passed through the red supergiant phase of its life , and this is now known to be far from an exceptional situation supergiants are rare and short-lived stars , but their high luminosity means that there are many naked-eye examples , including some of the brightest stars in the sky rigel , the brightest star in the constellation orion is a typical blue-white supergiant ; deneb is the brightest star in cygnus , a white supergiant ; delta cephei is the famous prototype cepheid variable , a yellow supergiant ; and betelgeuse , antares and uy scuti are red supergiants list of stars with resolved images planetary nebula
