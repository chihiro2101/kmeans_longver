although there are modchips that can be reprogrammed for different purposes , most modchips are designed to work within only one console system or even only one specific hardware version modchips typically require some degree of technical skill to install since they must be connected to a console 's circuitry , most commonly by soldering wires to select traces or chip legs on a system 's circuit board in addition to circumventing regional lockout and copy protection mechanisms , modern modchips may introduce more sophisticated modifications to the system , such as allowing the use of user-created software ( homebrew ) , expanding the hardware capabilities of its host system , or even installing an alternative operating system to completely re-purpose the host system ( e.g they react by removing the intrusion points exploited by a modchip from subsequent hardware or software versions , changing the pcb layout the modchips are customized for , or by having the firmware or software detect an installed modchip and refuse operation as a consequence xbox live terms of use , section 14 in an effort to dissuade modchip creation , some console manufacturers included the option to run homebrew software or even an alternative operating system on their consoles however , some of these features have been withdrawn at a later date other laws may apply to the many diversified functions of a modchip , e.g a small number of cases in the united kingdom and australia were dismissed under the argument that a system 's copy protection mechanism would not be able to prevent the actual infringement of copyright & mdash ; the actual process of copying game media & mdash ; and therefore can not be considered an effective technical protection measure protected by anti-circumvention laws in 2006 , australian copyright law has been amended to effectively close this legal loophole
