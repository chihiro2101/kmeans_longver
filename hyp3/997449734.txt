card clothing is made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded a later version of the card clothing product developed during the latter half of the 19th century and was found only on commercial carding machines , whereby a single piece of serrated wire was wrapped around a roller , became known as metallic card clothing the invention was later developed and improved by richard arkwright and samuel crompton arkwright 's second patent ( of 1775 ) for his carding machine was subsequently declared invalid ( 1785 ) because it lacked originality the first in wales was in a factory at dolobran near meifod in 1789 these carding mills produced yarn particularly for the wales flannel industry the combination of these two inventions became the standard for the carding industry , using machines first built by parr , curtis and walton in ancoats , and from 1857 by jams walton & sons at haughton dale there were 170 scribbling mills around leeds at that time modern machines are driven by belting from an electric motor or an overhead shaft via two pulleys the carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it in a wider sense carding can refer to the four processes of willowing , lapping , carding and drawing intermediate frames are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn , and then the roving frames reduces it to a finer thread , gives more twist , makes more regular and even in thickness , and winds onto a smaller tube these skills have survived as an artisan craft in less developed societies- and as art form and hobby in advanced societies rolag is peeled from the card '' in the grease '' means that the lanolin that naturally comes with the wool has not been washed out , leaving the wool with a slightly greasy feel hand carders ( and small drum carders too , though the directions may not recommend it ) can be used to card lanolin rich wool these carders do not store fibre in the card cloth as the drum carder does but , rather , fibre passes through the workings of the carder for storage or for additional processing by other machines the stripper , which turns at a higher speed than the worker , pulls fibres from the worker and passes them to the swift the slowly turning doffer removes the fibres from the swift and carries them to the fly comb where they are stripped from the doffer
