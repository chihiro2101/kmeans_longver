production use at csc began in january 1967 ) later in 1967 , cp/cms became generally available on the ibm system/360 model 67 , where , although the new control program cp-67 was a substantial re-implementation of cp-40 , cms remained essentially the same in 1972 , ibm released its vm/370 operating system , a re-implementation of cp/cms for the system/370 , in an announcement that also added virtual memory hardware to the system/370 series unlike cp/cms , vm/370 was supported by ibm many key user interface decisions familiar to today 's users had already been made in 1965 , as part of the cp-40 effort however , cms can no longer run outside the vm environment , which provides the hypervisor interface needed for various critical functions users log into vm , providing a userid and password , and then boot their own virtual machine many other manufacturers eventually offered bisync terminals that emulated the 3270 protocol commercial time-sharing users , an important segment of early cp/cms and vm sites , relied on such devices because they could connect via 300- or 1200 bit/s modems over normal voice-grade telephone circuits the 3270 approach was preferred the difference is apparent when comparing the atomic transaction approach of dominant cics with the interactive , stream-oriented style of unix vm/cms evolved somewhere between these extremes programming and major applications many cms users programmed in such languages as cobol , fortran , pl/i , c/370 , apl , and the scripting language rexx
