the protein attaches to the dna of other proteins and controls their activity through the forkhead-box domain three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in mice , while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human foxp2 protein from that found in chimpanzees , but only one of these changes is unique to humans transcription factors affect other regions , and the forkhead box p2 protein has been suggested to also act as a transcription factor for hundreds of genes brain imaging of affected individuals indicates functional abnormalities in language-related cortical and basal ganglia regions , demonstrating that the problems extend beyond the motor system mutations in foxp2 are among several ( 26 genes plus 2 intergenic ) loci which correlate to adhd diagnosis in adults – clinical adhd is an umbrella label for a heterogeneous group of genetic and neurological phenomena which may result from foxp2 mutations or other causes it is theorized that the translocation of the 7q31.2 region of the foxp2 gene causes a severe language impairment called developmental verbal dyspraxia ( dvd ) or childhood apraxia of speech ( cas ) so far this type of mutation has only been discovered in three families across the world including the original ke family these individuals present with deletions , translocations , and missense mutations these findings suggest that the effects of foxp2 are not limited to motor control , as they include comprehension among other cognitive language functions it has also been proposed that the foxp2 transcription-factor is not so much a hypothetical 'language gene ' but rather part of a regulatory machinery related to externalization of speech the human gene differs from that in non-human primates by the substitution of two amino acids , a threonine to asparagine substitution at position 303 ( t303n ) and an asparagine to serine substitution at position 325 ( n325s ) sapiens version would have appeared in neanderthals living 43,000 years ago insertion of both human mutations into mice , whose version of foxp2 otherwise differs from the human and chimpanzee versions in only one additional base pair , causes changes in vocalizations as well as other behavioral changes , such as a reduction in exploratory tendencies , and a decrease in maze learning time foxp2 is known to regulate cntnap2 , ctbp1 , srpx2 and scn3a researchers deduced that there could also be further clinical applications in the direction of these studies in regards to illnesses that show effects on human language ability in comparison to knockout mice with one non-functional copy of foxp2 , the humanized mouse model showed opposite effects when testing its effect on the levels of dopamine , plasticity of synapses , patterns of expression in the striatum and behavior that was exploratory in nature contrary to apes and mice , foxp2 is extremely diverse in microbat in songbirds , foxp2 most likely regulates genes involved in neuroplasticity gene knockdown of foxp2 in area x of the basal ganglia in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation similarly , in adult canaries , higher foxp2 levels also correlate with song changes “ undirected ” singing occurs when for example , a male sings when other males are present or is alone in zebrafish , foxp2 is expressed in the ventral and dorsal thalamus , telencephalon , diencephalon where it likely plays a role in nervous system development ) in 1995 , the university of oxford and the institute of child health researchers found that the disorder was purely genetic in 1998 , oxford university geneticists simon fisher , anthony monaco , cecilia s lai , jane a mapping and sequencing of the chromosomal region was performed with the aid of bacterial artificial chromosome clones as such , it was assigned with the official name of foxp2 further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of foxp2 disruption , including different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements , providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development .
