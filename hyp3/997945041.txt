alpha-helical proteins in outer membranes include stannin and certain lipoproteins , and others this is the major category of transmembrane proteins in humans , 27 % of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins this peptide is secreted by gram-positive bacteria as an antibiotic types i , ii , iii and iv are bitopic protein ; molecular cell biology , sixth edition , p.546 the implications for the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and er-bound translation , when the protein has to be passed through the er membrane in a direction dependent on the type stephen white laboratory homepage hence , despite the significant functional importance of membrane proteins , determining atomic resolution structures for these proteins is more difficult than globular proteins transmembrane helix proteins are unusually stable judging from thermal denaturation studies , because they do not unfold completely within the membranes ( the complete unfolding would require breaking down too many Î±-helical h-bonds in the nonpolar media ) transmembrane cytochrome b-like proteins : coenzyme q - cytochrome c reductase ( cytochrome bc1 ) ; cytochrome b6f complex ; formate dehydrogenase , respiratory nitrate reductase ; succinate - coenzyme q reductase ( fumarate reductase ) ; and succinate dehydrogenase porters ( uniporters , symporters , antiporters ) they include : ompa-like transmembrane domain ( ompa ) virulence-related outer membrane protein family ( ompx ) outer membrane protein w family ( ompw ) antimicrobial peptide resistance and lipid a acylation protein family ( pagp ) lipid a deacylase pagl opacity family porins ( nspa ) autotransporter domain ( n 12 , s 14 ) fadl outer membrane protein transport family , including fatty acid transporter fadl ( n 14 , s 14 ) general bacterial porin family , known as trimeric porins ( n 16 , s 20 ) maltoporin , or sugar porins ( n 18 , s 22 ) nucleoside-specific porin ( n 12 , s 16 ) outer membrane phospholipase a1 ( n 12 , s 16 ) tonb-dependent receptors and their plug domain
