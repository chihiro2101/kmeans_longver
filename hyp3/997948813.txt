this distinction dates to the greek philosopher theophrastus ( 370–285 & nbsp ; bc ) , the '' father of botany '' , who was keenly aware of this difference '' as is the present convention i now propose another name , cultivar , for a botanical variety , or for a race subordinate to species , that has originated under cultivation ; it is not necessarily , however , referable to a recognized botanical species bailey created the word cultivar , which is generally assumed to be a portmanteau of cultivated and variety a cultigen or a component of a cultigen can be accepted as a cultivar if it is recognisable and has stable characters therefore , all cultivars are cultigens , because they are cultivated , but not all cultigens are cultivars , because some cultigens have not been formally distinguished and named as cultivars 3 the code then defines a cultivar as a '' taxonomic unit within the classification category of cultivar '' the production of cultivars generally entails considerable human involvement although in a few cases it may be as little as simply selecting variation from plants growing in the wild ( whether by collecting growing tissue to propagate from or by gathering seed ) cultivated plant code , article 2.20 cultivars generally occur as ornamentals and food crops : malus 'granny smith ' and malus 'red delicious ' are cultivars of apples propagated by cuttings or grafting , lactuca 'red sails ' and lactuca 'great lakes ' are lettuce cultivars propagated by seeds image : leucospermum cultivar edit.jpg right thumb 220px leucospermum 'scarlet ribbon ' a cross performed in tasmania between l cultivated plant code , articles 2.5–2.11 in general , asexually propagated cultivars grown from seeds produce highly variable seedling plants , and should not be labelled with , or sold under , the parent cultivar 's name some cultivars are agamospermy plants , which retain their genetic composition and characteristics under reproduction a cultivar name consists of a botanical name ( of a genus , species , infraspecific taxon , interspecific hybrid or intergeneric hybrid ) followed by a cultivar epithet 14 : examples of correct text presentation : : : cryptomeria japonica 'elegans' : : chamaecyparis lawsoniana 'aureomarginata ' ( pre-1959 name , latin in form ) : : chamaecyparis lawsoniana 'golden wonder ' ( post-1959 name , english language ) : : pinus densiflora 'akebono ' ( post-1959 name , japanese language ) : : apple 'sundown' : some incorrect text presentation examples : : : cryptomeria japonica '' elegans '' ( double quotes are unacceptable ) : : berberis thunbergii cv cultivated plant code art according to proponents of such protections , if other growers can immediately propagate and sell these cultivars as soon as they come on the market , the breeder 's benefit is largely lost 1295–1307 legal protection for cultivars is obtained through the use of plant breeders ’ rights and plant patents but the specific legislation and procedures needed to take advantage of this protection vary from country to country marketing names lie outside the scope of the cultivated plant code which refers to them as '' trade designations '' plants protected by plant breeders ' rights ( pbr ) may have a '' true '' cultivar name – the recognized scientific name in the public domain – and a '' commercial synonym '' – an additional marketing name that is legally protected the main body coordinating plant breeders ' rights is the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants , upov ) and this organization maintains a database of new cultivars protected by pbr in all countries one major aim is to prevent the duplication of cultivar and group epithets within a genus , as well as ensuring that names are in accord with the latest edition of the cultivated plant code published in hard copy , with a description in a dated publication ) they record details about the plant , such as parentage , the names of those concerned with its development and introduction , and a basic description highlighting its distinctive characters
