for every possible state of the system or allowed combination of values of the system 's parameters , a point is included in the multidimensional space coordinates on configuration space ) defines conjugate momentum p i which together define co-ordinates on phase space statistical ensembles in phase space classic examples of phase diagrams from chaos theory are : the lorenz attractor population growth ( i.e with j e moyal ( 1949 ) , these completed the foundations of the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics , a complete and logically autonomous reformulation of quantum mechanics thus , by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space ( the same ambit as for classical mechanics ) , the weyl map facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a deformation ( generalization ) of classical mechanics , with deformation parameter Ä§/s , where s is the action of the relevant process ( other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical newtonian into special relativity , with deformation parameter v/c ; or the deformation of newtonian gravity into general relativity , with deformation parameter schwarzschild radius/characteristic-dimension thermodynamics and statistical mechanics if a thermodynamic system consists of n particles , then a point in the 6n-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system , as each particle is associated with three-position variables and three momentum variables a point in this phase space is correspondingly called a macrostate instead of summing the boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states ( defined by appropriate integer quantum numbers for each degree of freedom ) one may integrate over continuous phase space phase line , 1-dimensional case phase plane , 2-dimensional case phase portrait phase space method parameter space separatrix ; applications optical phase space state space ( controls ) for information about state space ( similar to phase state ) in control engineering
