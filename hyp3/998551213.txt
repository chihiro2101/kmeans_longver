it is the most frequent type of natural strabismus not only in humans , but also in monkeys however , the vast majority of intermittent esotropias are accommodative in origin the person with hyperopia , in an attempt to '' accommodate '' or focus the eyes , converges the eyes as well , as convergence is associated with activation of the accommodation reflex the chances of an esotropia developing in a hyperopic child will depend to some degree on the amount of hyperopia present however , where the degree of error is small enough to allow the child to generate clear vision by over-accommodation , but large enough to disrupt their binocular control , esotropia will result it is a constant esotropia of large and consistent size with onset between birth and six months of age it is , however , associated with other ocular dysfunctions including oblique muscle over-actions , dissociated vertical deviation ( dvd ) , manifest latent nystagmus , and defective abduction , which develops as a consequence of the tendency of those with infantile esotropia to 'cross fixate they can occur in both childhood and adulthood , and arise as a result of neurological , mechanical or myogenic problems ' in an alternating esotropia , the patient is able to alternate fixation between their right and left eye so that at one moment the right eye fixates and the left eye turns inward , and at the next the left eye fixates and the right turns inward esotropias can be concomitant , where the size of the deviation does not vary with direction of gazeâ€”or incomitant , where the direction of gaze does affect the size , or indeed presence , of the esotropia primary , secondary or consecutive however , in general , management will take the following course : identify and treat any underlying systemic condition in specific cases , and primarily in adult patients , botulinum toxin can be used either as a permanent therapeutic approach , or as a temporary measure to prevent contracture of muscles prior to surgery where necessary , extra-ocular muscle surgery , like strabismus surgery , which is a surgery where the doctors physically move the muscle that is making the eye contract
