first , silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 & nbsp ; °c to produce trichlorosilane , hsicl 3 , along with hydrogen gas , according to the chemical equation : : si + 3 hcl → hsicl 3 + h 2 the trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride the silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in sicl 4 and the lowest formal oxidation state in sih 4 since cl is far more electronegative than is h freeman and company , new york , 2010 , p '' a comprehensive treatise on inorganic and theoretical chemistry , '' vol vi , longmans , green and co originally published in popular science magazine it can be written as : :4 hcl + mg 2 si → sih 4 + 2 mgcl 2 in general , the alkaline-earth metals form silicides with the following stoichiometry : m ii 2 si , m ii si , and m ii si 2 one consequence of this reversed polarity is the greater tendency of silane to form complexes with transition metals however , the difficulties in explaining the available ( often contradictory ) combustion data are ascribed to the fact that silane itself is stable and that the natural formation of larger silanes during production , as well as the sensitivity of combustion to impurities such as moisture and to the catalytic effects of container surfaces causes its pyrophoricity american air , liquide inc silane is a pyrophoric gas ( capable of autoignition at temperatures below 54 & nbsp ; °c /130 & nbsp ; °f ) silane msds : sih 4 + 2 o 2 → sio 2 + 2 h 2 o with δh –1517 kj/mol –47.23 kj/g : sih 4 + o 2 → sio 2 + 2 h 2 : sih 4 + o 2 → sih 2 o + h 2 o :2 sih 4 + o 2 → 2 sih 2 o + 2h 2 : sih 2 o + o 2 → sio 2 + h 2 o for lean mixtures a two-stage reaction process has been proposed , which consists of a silane consumption process and a hydrogen oxidation process in japan , in order to reduce the danger of silane for amorphous silicon solar cell manufacturing , several companies began to dilute silane with hydrogen gas
