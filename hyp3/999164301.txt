geoid the geoid surface is irregular , unlike the reference ellipsoid ( which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical earth ) , but is considerably smoother than earth 's physical surface the permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography to obtain one 's geoidal height , a raw gps reading must be corrected conversely , height determined by spirit leveling from a tidal measurement station , as in traditional land surveying , is always geoidal height modern gps receivers have a grid implemented in the source of the geoid ( e.g then , they are able to correct the height above wgs ellipsoid to the height above egm96 geoid the gravitational field of the earth is not uniform this would not mean that water flows upward in these locations , despite sea level 's greater distance from earth 's center : '' upward '' is defined by the direction away from gravity 's pull , not by distance from earth 's center the current best such set of spherical harmonic coefficients is egm2020 ( earth gravity model 2020 ) , determined in an international collaborative project led by the national imagery and mapping agency ( now the national geospatial-intelligence agency , or nga ) new even higher resolution models are currently under development the precise geoid solution by vaníček and co-workers improved on the stokesian approach to geoid computation synthetic calculations show that the geoidal signature of a thickened crust ( for example , in orogen produced by continental collision ) is positive , opposite to what should be expected if the thickening affects the entire lithosphere recent satellite missions , such as the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer ( goce ) and grace , have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals
