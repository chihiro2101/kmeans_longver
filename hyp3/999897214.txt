many variations of design are used in practice ; the design shown is merely illustrative the side-on design is used , for instance , in the type 931 , the first mass-produced pmt it is worthwhile to note that heinrich hertz , working 18 years earlier , had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity the first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an rca group based in harrison , nj harley iams and bernard salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain at the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 ( very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes ) slepian by 1919 ( see above ) in the ussr , rca-manufactured radio equipment was introduced on a large scale by joseph stalin to construct broadcast networks , and the newly formed all-union scientific research institute for television was gearing up a research program in vacuum tubes that was advanced for its time and place the device achieved gains of 1000x or more when demonstrated in june 1934 electrostatic photomultipliers ( 1937–present ) pike , rca technical report tr-362 , '' electrostatic focusing in secondary emission multipliers , '' september 9 , 1937 20006 ( 1964 ) the philosophy included the idea that the product 's user need only be concerned about the response of the device rather than how the device may be fabricated rca was also largely responsible for the commercialization of photomultiplers the company compiled and published an authoritative and widely used photomultiplier handbook lancaster , pennsylvania facility navy in 1942 and operated by rca for the manufacture of radio and microwave tubes following world war ii , the naval facility was acquired by rca burle industries , as a successor to the rca corporation , carried the rca photomultiplier business forward after 1986 , based in the lancaster , pennsylvania facility the most common photocathode materials are photomultiplier tubes construction and operating characteristics high dark current ; used mainly in near-infrared , with the photocathode cooled ; gaas : cs , caesium-activated gallium arsenide , flat response from 300 to 850 & nbsp ; nm , fading towards ultraviolet and to 930 & nbsp ; nm ; ingaas : cs , caesium-activated indium gallium arsenide , higher infrared sensitivity than gaas : cs , between 900–1000 & nbsp ; nm much higher signal-to-noise ratio than ag-o-cs ; sb-cs , ( also called s11 ) caesium-activated antimony , used for reflective mode photocathodes ; response range from ultraviolet to visible , widely used ; bialkali ( sb-k-cs , sb-rb-cs ) , caesium-activated antimony-rubidium or antimony-potassium alloy , similar to sb : cs , with higher sensitivity and lower noise the windows of the photomultipliers act as wavelength filters ; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range , but special care has to be taken for uncommon wavelengths glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope synthetic silica transmits down to 160 & nbsp ; nm , absorbs less uv than fused silica ( see figure near top of article while powered ( energized ) , photomultipliers must be shielded from ambient light to prevent their destruction through overexcitation if used in a location with strong magnetic fields , which can curve electron paths , steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain , photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or mu-metal photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as compound semiconductors and quantum dots perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts , electronically , as a nearly perfect current source , owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals , by 100 thousand times ( i.e , 100 & nbsp ; db ) or more for smaller photon fluxes , the photomultiplier can be operated in photon-counting , or geiger , mode ( see also single-photon avalanche diode ) in geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high ( using high voltage ) that a single photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit the drawback , however , is that not every photon incident on the primary surface is counted either because of less-than-perfect efficiency of the photomultiplier , or because a second photon can arrive at the photomultiplier during the '' dead time '' associated with a first photon and never be noticed , '' the photomultiplier handbook '' , 616pp , oxford university press , oxford , england ( 2017 ) engstrom , ralph w , photomultiplier handbook , rca/burle ( 1980 )
