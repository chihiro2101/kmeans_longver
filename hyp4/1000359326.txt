larger airports usually have several runways in different directions , so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind note that wind direction is given as the direction the wind is coming from : a plane taking off from runway 09 faces east , into an '' east wind '' blowing from 090° not much was known about wind behaviour this also includes some military airfields such as cairns army airfield in flight simulator those of american origin might apply u.s usage to airports around the world if there is more than one runway pointing in the same direction ( parallel runways ) , each runway is identified by appending left & nbsp ; ( l ) , center & nbsp ; ( c ) and right & nbsp ; ( r ) to the end of the runway number to identify its position ( when facing its direction ) —for example , runways one-five-left & nbsp ; ( 15l ) , one-five-center & nbsp ; ( 15c ) , and one-five-right & nbsp ; ( 15r ) occasionally , an airport with only three parallel runways may use different runway identifiers , such as when a third parallel runway was opened at phoenix sky harbor international airport in 2000 to the south of existing 8r/26l—rather than confusingly becoming the '' new '' 8r/26l it was instead designated 7r/25l , with the former 8r/26l becoming 7l/25r and 8l/26r becoming 8/26 if on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226° ( runway & nbsp ; 23 ) , and the heading decreased by only 2 & nbsp ; degrees to 224° , the runway becomes runway & nbsp ; 22 takeoff and landing distances available are given using one of the following terms : ; tora : takeoff run available – the length of runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane taking off faa ac 150/5340-1l – standards for airport markings pages 13 and following the runway thresholds are markings across the runway that denote the beginning and end of the designated space for landing and takeoff under non-emergency conditions displaced thresholds may be used for taxiing , takeoff , and landing rollout , but not for touchdown larger runways have a distance remaining sign ( black box with white numbers ) also , radio communication may not be available and pilots must be self-reliant precision runways provide both horizontal and vertical guidance for instrument approaches waterways may be unmarked or marked with buoys that follow maritime notation instead faa-h-8083-23 , seaplane , skiplane , and float/ski equipped helicopter operations handbook ( chapters 1–3 ) some european countries replace the aiming point with a 3-stripe touchdown zone this also occurs in some airports in japan , sweden , and finland runway end lights – a pair of four lights on each side of the runway on precision instrument runways , these lights extend along the full width of the runway it starts with green light at about the runway centerline to the position of first centerline light beyond the hold-short markings on the taxiway transport canada aeronautical information manual control of lighting system smaller airports may not have lighted runways or runway markings particularly at private airfields for light planes , there may be nothing more than a windsock beside a landing strip runway overrun ( also known as an overshoot ) – a type of excursion where the aircraft is unable to stop before the end of the runway ( e.g aeroflot flight 3352 , linate airport disaster ) singapore airlines flight 006 , western airlines flight 2605 ) it is always accommodated , although occasionally with a delay an aircraft taking off at a higher altitude must do so at reduced weight due to decreased density of air at higher altitudes , which reduces engine power and wing lift most commercial aircraft carry manufacturer 's tables showing the adjustments required for a given temperature united states aeronautical information manual – federal aviation administration ( published yearly ) united states airport/facility directory ( d-afd ) – federal aviation administration ( published every 56 days ) united states terminal procedures publication/airport diagrams ( d-tpp ) – federal aviation administration ( published every 28 days ) north american powered parachute federation visual aids handbook – civil aviation authority
