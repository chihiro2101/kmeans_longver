floaters are from objects in pockets of liquid within the vitreous humour , the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye , or between the vitreous and the retina however , attempting to shift one 's gaze toward them can be difficult because floaters follow the motion of the eye , remaining to the side of the direction of gaze despite the name '' floaters '' , many of these specks have a tendency to sink toward the bottom of the eyeball , in whichever way the eyeball is oriented ; the supine position ( looking up or lying back ) tends to concentrate them near the fovea , which is the center of gaze , while the textureless and evenly lit sky forms an ideal background against which to view them for persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to ignore completely the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view . vitreous detachments and retinal detachments as a complication , part of the retina might be torn off by the departing vitreous membrane , in a process known as retinal detachment consequently , both the appearance of flashes and the sudden onset of numerous small floaters should be rapidly investigated by an eye care provider regression of the hyaloid artery other causes for floaters include cystoid macular edema and asteroid hyalosis floaters are often readily observed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist with the use of an ophthalmoscope or slit lamp 2009 november 25 ; 302 ( 20 ) :2243–9 patients with new onset flashes and/or floaters , especially when associated with visual loss or restriction in the visual field , should seek more urgent ophthalmologic evaluation a 2017 cochrane review did not find any relevant studies that compared the two treatments of these small gauge instruments , one is an infusion port to resupply a saline solution and maintain the pressure of the eye , the second is a fiber optic light source , and the third is a vitrector like most invasive surgical procedures , however , vitrectomy carries a risk of complications , including : retinal detachment , anterior vitreous detachment and macular edema – which can threaten vision or worsen existing floaters ( in the case of retinal detachment ) posterior capsulotomy and iridotomy treatments however , the medicinenet web site states that '' there is no evidence that this laser treatment is effective
