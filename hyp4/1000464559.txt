millikan in 1891 226x226px starting in 1908 , while a professor at the university of chicago , millikan , with the significant input of fletcher , and after improving his setup , published his seminal study in 1913 in return , millikan used his influence in support of fletcher 's career at bell labs millikan and fletcher 's experiment involved measuring the force on oil droplets in a glass chamber sandwiched between two electrodes , one above and one below experimenting with cathode rays in 1897 , j most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism , however , could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable ; in much the same way that many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a continuous wave rather than as a stream of photons in 1923 , millikan won the nobel prize in physics , in part because of this experiment alternatively , charging could be brought about by including an ionising radiation source ( such as an x-ray tube ) the droplets entered the space between the plates and , because they were charged , could be made to rise and fall by changing the voltage across the plates ( this is because the upwards electric force f e is greater for them than the downwards gravitational force f g , in the same way bits of paper can be picked by a charged rubber rod ) this enabled millikan to claim that he had calculated e to better than one half of one percent ; in fact , if millikan had included all of the data he had thrown out , the standard error of the mean would have been within 2 %
