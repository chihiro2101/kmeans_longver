according to keynesian economics , fluctuations in aggregate demand cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output in particular , the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions , and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle post-keynesian economist hyman minsky has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit , interest rates and financial frailty , called the financial instability hypothesis banks are not reluctant to grant them loans , because expanding economic activity allows business increasing cash flows and therefore they will be able to easily pay back the loans within mainstream economics , keynesian views have been challenged by real business cycle models in which fluctuations are due to random changes in the total productivity factor ( which are caused by changes in technology as well as the legal and regulatory environment ) kydland and edward c '' economic insights 4 , no . product based theory of economic cycles the political business cycle is an alternative theory stating that when an administration of any hue is elected , it initially adopts a contractionary policy to reduce inflation and gain a reputation for economic competence '' alternative approaches to the political business cycle , '' brookings papers on economic activity , p pp the replacement , regime b , adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth , and the downwards swing of the cycle for marx , the economy based on production of commodities to be sold in the market is intrinsically prone to crisis henryk grossman grossman , henryk the law of accumulation and breakdown of the capitalist system paul mattick , marx and keynes : the limits of mixed economy , boston , porter sargent , 1969 the american mathematician and economist richard m kauermann , and t 1 ( april 2011 ) reiner franke , peter flaschel , and christian r interview in barron 's magazine , aug 24 , 1998 archived at hoover institution r garrison , '' f a different measure of the slope ( i.e the difference between 10-year treasury bond rates and the federal funds rate ) is incorporated into the index of leading economic indicators published by the conference board an inverted yield curve is often a harbinger of recession arturo estrella and tobias adrian , frb of new york staff report no hansen , alvin h new york : w norton & company , 1964 , p mitigating an economic downturn in this view , all that the government can do is to change the timing of economic crises friedman has gone so far as to argue that all the central bank of a country should do is to avoid making large mistakes , as he believes they did by contracting the money supply very rapidly in the face of the wall street crash of 1929 , in which they made what would have been a recession into the great depression .
