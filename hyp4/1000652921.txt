melanogaster has a fat body , which is analogous to the human liver the cellular immune response instead refers to the direct activity of blood cells ( hemocytes ) in drosophila , which are analogous to mammalian monocytes/macrophages hemocytes also possess a significant role in mediating humoral immune responses such as the melanization reaction . the drosophila toll pathway culminating in a nobel prize in 2011 this regulatory cascade is initiated following pathogen recognition by pattern recognition receptors , particularly of gram-positive bacteria , parasites , and fungal infection upon infection , pro-spatzle is cleaved by the protease spe ( spatzle processing enzyme ) to become active spatzle , which binds to the toll receptor located on the cell surface of the fat body and dimerizes for activation of downstream nf-κb signaling pathways , including multiple death domain containing proteins and negative regulators such as the ankyrin repeat protein cactus another group of toll-regulated amp-like effectors includes the bomanins , which appear to be responsible for the bulk of toll-mediated immune defence , however bomanins alone do not exhibit antimicrobial activity . the drosophila imd pathway imd signalling and relish specifically are also involved in the regulation of immunity at surface epithelia including in the gut and respiratory tracts jak-stat induction leads to the production of a number of stress response proteins including thioester-containing proteins ( teps ) , turandots , and the putative antimicrobial peptide listericin . the cellular response to infection . behavioral genetics and neuroscience in 1971 , ron konopka and seymour benzer published '' clock mutants of drosophila melanogaster '' , a paper describing the first mutations that affected an animal 's behavior they found mutants with faster and slower rhythms , as well as broken rhythms—flies that move and rest in random spurts the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for 2017 was awarded to jeffrey c hall , michael rosbash , michael w as with most insects , aggressive behaviors between male flies commonly occur in the presence of courting a female and when competing for resources rna-seq from fly mutants displaying over-aggressive behaviors found more than 50 auditory-related genes ( important for transient receptor potentials , calcium signaling , and mechanoreceptor potentials ) to be upregulated in the ab neurons located in johnston 's organ specifically , when competing for food , aggression occurs based on amount of food available and is independent of any social interactions between males effect of sleep deprivation due to reduced aggression , sleep-deprived male flies were found to be disadvantaged at mating compared to normal flies , modeling such human diseases as parkinson 's , neoplasm , obesity , and diabetes the compound eye of the fruit fly contains 760 unit eyes or ommatidia , and are one of the most advanced among insects each ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells ( r1-8 ) , support cells , pigment cells , and a cornea each microvillus is 1–2 μm in length and about 60 nm in diameter the photoreceptors in drosophila express a variety of rhodopsin isoforms the r1-r6 photoreceptor cells express rhodopsin1 ( rh1 ) , which absorbs blue light ( 480 & nbsp ; nm ) plcβ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol ( 4,5 ) -bisphosphate ( pip 2 ) , a phospholipid found in the cell membrane , into soluble inositol triphosphate ( ip 3 ) and diglyceride ( dag ) , which stays in the cell membrane unlike vertebrate metarhodopsin , invertebrate metarhodopsin can be converted back into rhodopsin by absorbing a photon of orange light ( 580 & nbsp ; nm ) using their hind legs , drosophila proceed to groom their abdomen , and finally the wings and thorax this means that grooming behaviors that occur at the beginning of the sequence prevent those that come later in the sequence from occurring simultaneously , as the grooming sequence consists of mutually exclusive behaviors this hierarchy does not prevent drosophila from returning to grooming behaviors that have already been accessed in the grooming sequence this means that three of the legs swing together while the other three remain stationary , or in stance however , subsequent work showed that while the viscous effects on the insect body during flight may be negligible , the aerodynamic forces on the wings themselves actually cause fruit flies ' turns to be damped viscously
