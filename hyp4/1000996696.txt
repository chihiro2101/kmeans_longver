this section summarizes some of the more common definitions and the relations between them for a compact n-dimensional kähler manifold m the following conditions are equivalent to each other , but are weaker than the conditions above , though they are sometimes used as the definition of a calabi & ndash ; yau manifold : m has vanishing first real chern class m has a kähler metric with vanishing ricci curvature m has a finite cover that is a product of a torus and a simply connected manifold with trivial canonical bundle if a compact kähler manifold is simply connected , then the weak definition above is equivalent to the stronger definition any calabi–yau manifold has a finite cover that is the product of a torus and a simply-connected calabi–yau manifold enriques surfaces and hyperelliptic surfaces have first chern class that vanishes as an element of the real cohomology group , but not as an element of the integral cohomology group , so yau 's theorem about the existence of a ricci-flat metric still applies to them but they are sometimes not considered to be calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds applications in superstring theory compactification on calabi & ndash ; yau n-folds are important because they leave some of the original supersymmetry unbroken f-theory compactifications on various calabi & ndash ; yau four-folds provide physicists with a method to find a large number of classical solutions in the so-called string theory landscape although the following statement has been simplified , it conveys the logic of the argument : if the calabi–yau has three holes , then three families of vibrational patterns and thus three families of particles will be observed experimentally this is true of all particle properties im , mee seong ( 2008 ) '' singularities-in-calabi-yau-varieties.pdf singularities in calabi & ndash ; yau varieties '' yau , shing-tung and nadis , steve ; the shape of inner space , basic books , 2010 calabi & ndash ; yau homepage is an interactive reference which describes many examples and classes of calabi & ndash ; yau manifolds and also the physical theories in which they appear
