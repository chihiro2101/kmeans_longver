in his hands , it meant something akin to contemporary proof theory , in which finitary methods are used to study various axiomatized mathematical theorems ( kleene 1952 , p the discovery of hyperbolic geometry when gauss discovered hyperbolic geometry , it is said that he did not publish anything about it out of fear of the '' uproar of the boeotians '' , which would ruin his status as princeps mathematicorum ( latin , '' the prince of mathematicians '' ) begriffsschrift is usually translated as concept writing or concept notation ; the full title of the book identifies it as '' a formula language , modeled on that of arithmetic , of pure thought one of the main inspirations and motivations for pm was the earlier work of gottlob frege on logic , which russell discovered allowed for the construction of paradoxical sets contemporary mathematics , however , avoids paradoxes such as russell 's in less unwieldy ways , such as the system of zermelo–fraenkel set theory gödel 's incompleteness theorem the two results are widely , but not universally , interpreted as showing that hilbert 's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible , giving a negative answer to hilbert 's second problem the impossibility of the entscheidungsproblem hilbert and ackermann the asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement of a first-order logic ( possibly with a finite number of axioms beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic ) and answers '' yes '' or '' no '' according to whether the statement is universally valid , i.e
