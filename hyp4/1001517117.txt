right-wing nationalist and militarist circles opposed the new republic and promoted the stab-in-the-back myth , claiming that the war had been lost only because the efforts of the undefeated german military had been undermined by civilians at home under the terms of the treaty of versailles , which came into effect on 10 january 1920 , germany was required to reduce its land forces to a maximum of 100,000 men freikorps units were expected to be disbanded run-up to the coup thumb although the putsch has been named after wolfgang kapp , a 62-year-old nationalist east prussian civil servant , who had been planning a coup against the republic for a while , it was instigated by the military ; kapp played a supporting role several of lüttwitz ' officers were horrified at this open rejection of the government 's authority and tried to mediate , by setting up a meeting between lüttwitz and the leaders of the two major right-wing parties ebert and noske rejected these demands and noske told lüttwitz that he expected his resignation the next day lüttwitz went to döberitz on 11 march and asked ehrhardt whether he would be able to occupy berlin that evening to defend the government , noske ordered two regiments of sicherheitspolizei and one regular regiment to take position in the government quarter but doubted that a putsch was imminent on the evening of 12 march , ehrhardt ordered his brigade to march into berlin , to '' ruthlessly break any resistance '' ( jeden widerstand rücksichtslos zu brechen ) and to occupy the centre of the city with the government buildings seeckt spoke about comradeship his exact words were not recorded , but have been reported as : '' troops do not fire on troops only ebert and the spd ministers signed the call for a general strike lüttwitz served as commander of the armed forces and minister of defence admiral adolf von trotha , the navy commander , came out in support of the coup as soon as he learned of it in the rest of the reich , the commanders of the wehrkreise ( military districts ) did not declare for or against kapp but were not neutral and most sympathised more or less openly with the putschists the cabinet proclamation on 13 march , calling on german workers to defeat the putsch by means of a general strike met with enormous success and received massive support from the working class the majority unions , sympathetic to the government dominated by spd , joined the call for a strike on the same day , as did the independent social democratic party ( uspd ) and the democratic party ; the communist party of germany ( kpd ) followed one day later the country was paralysed hitler and eckart were approached by ignaz trebitsch-lincoln , who told them that kapp had fled and the coup failed werner maser : der sturm auf die republik kapp remained in the country and only fled to sweden in april both men used passports provided by supporters in the police '' among the grievances which kapp and his followers had against the government were that the national assembly , which had been elected to serve temporarily , was beginning to act as a permanent reichstag and that it seemed this assembly might revise the constitution with respect to the election of the president of the republic , which would make the reichstag , rather than the electorate , responsible for the presidential election in some parts of the country , the strike had turned into an armed revolt in the ruhr , the workers won and did not stop after the putsch in berlin had collapsed the courts were much harsher on the members of the red ruhr army , many of whom were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment image : monument to the march dead.jpg thumb monument to the march dead , by walter gropius between 1920 and 1922 a monument in honour of the workers who were killed in the wake of the kapp putsch was erected in the weimar central cemetery the memorial was commissioned by the weimar gewerkschaftskartell ( union cartel ) , which conducted a competition to select a design although gropius had said that the bauhaus should remain politically neutral , he agreed to participate in the competition of weimar artists at the end of 1920 the repeatedly fractured and highly angular memorial rose up on three sides , as if thrust up from or rammed into the earth gilbert lupfer & paul sigel , walter gropius , 1883–1969 : the promoter of a new form , p
