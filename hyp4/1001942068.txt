the forms of the mutations may vary between ethnic groups in 2006 , another mutation ( c.13_14delct ) was discovered which may contribute to increased symptoms in addition to the common arg50stop mutation the myophosphorylase structure consists of 842 amino acids lys-680 is involved in binding the pyridoxal phosphate , which is the active form of vitamin b6 , a cofactor required by myophosphorylase cells form glucose-1-phosphate instead of glucose during glycogen breakdown because the polar , phosphorylated glucose can not leave the cell membrane and so is marked for intracellular catabolism the enzyme phosphorylase kinase plays a role in phosphorylating glycogen phosphorylase to activate it and another enzyme , protein phosphatase 1 , inactivates glycogen phosphorylase through dephosphorylation dna sequencing of the pygm gene ( which codes for the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase ) may be done to determine the presence of mutation , determining if mcardle 's is present update 2014 the physician can also perform an ischemic forearm exercise test as described above serum lactate may fail to rise in part because of increased uptake via the monocarboxylate transporter 1 , which is upregulated in skeletal muscle in mcardle disease ammonia levels may rise given ammonia is a by-product of the adenylate kinase , an alternative pathway for atp production in some , the level is increased by multitudes - a person without gsd-v will have a ck between 60 and 400iu/l , while a person with the syndrome may have a level of 5,000 iu/l at rest , and may increase to 35,000 iu/l or more with muscle exertion oral sucrose treatment ( for example a sports drink with 75 grams of sucrose in 660 ml the deficiency was the first metabolic myopathy to be recognized , when dr
