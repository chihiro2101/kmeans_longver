spelling is easier in languages with more or less consistent spelling systems such as finnish , serbian , italian and spanish , owing to the fact that , either , pronunciation in these languages has changed relatively little since the establishment of their spelling-systems , or else that non-phonemic etymological spellings have been replaced with phonemic unetymological spellings as pronunciation changes spelling reforms have been proposed for various languages over the years ; these have ranged from modest attempts to eliminate particular irregularities ( such as sr1 or initial teaching alphabet ) through more far-reaching reforms ( such as cut spelling ) to attempts to introduce a full phonemic orthography , like the shavian alphabet or its revised version , quikscript , the latest devagreek alphabet , extended english alphabet with devanagari orthography the turkish alphabet or hangul in korea redundancy of letters is often an issue in spelling reform , which prompts the '' economic argument '' —significant cost savings in the production materials over time—as promulgated by george bernard shaw it is also argued that when people read , they do not try to work out the series of sounds composing each word , but instead they recognize words either as a whole or as a short series of meaningful units ( for example morphology might be read as morph+ology , rather than as a longer series of phonemes ) many technical terms are more common in writing than in speech , so their pronunciation is almost irrelevant and it should not influence their spelling english has generally preserved the original spelling when borrowing words ; and even more importantly , english began to be widely written and printed during the middle english period : the later development of modern english included a great vowel shift and many other changes in phonology , yet the older spellings , which are no longer phonetic , have been kept oxford english dictionary , 1st edition , ss.vv a phonemic system would therefore not be universal in the 1950s , the language reform committee of the people 's republic of china devised the pinyin orthography and promulgated it as the official romanization system of mainland china since pinyin became the international standard for chinese romanization in 1982 , other romanizations ( including the wade-giles system , gwoyeu romatzyh developed by yuen ren chao , and latinxua sin wenz ) have become rarely used the dutch language union , founded in 1980 by the netherlands and belgium , is now the source of official reforms even though german spelling was already more consistent than english or french spelling , the german language countries signed an agreement on spelling reforms in 1996 ; these were planned to be gradually introduced beginning in 1998 and fully in force by 2005 in summer 2004 , various newspapers and magazines returned to the old spelling , and in march 2006 , the most controversial changes of rechtschreibreform were reverted later reforms ( brazil , 1943 and 1971 ; portugal , 1945 and 1973 ) have aimed mainly at three goals : to eliminate the few remnants of redundant etymological spelling , to reduce the number of words marked with diacritics and hyphens , and to bring the brazilian spelling standard and the portuguese spelling standard ( used in all the portuguese speaking countries , except brazil ) closer to each other the goal of unifying the spelling was finally achieved with a multi-lateral agreement in 1990 , signed by every portuguese-speaking country , but not ratified by angola as of 2014 when peter i introduced his '' civil script '' , in 1708 , based on more western-looking letter shapes , spelling was simplified as well bulgarian underwent a spelling reform in 1945 , following the russian model several cyrillic alphabets with 28 to 44 letters were used in the beginning and middle of the 19th century during the effort to codify modern bulgarian until an alphabet with 32 letters , proposed by marin drinov , gained prominence in the 1870s the reform efforts were coordinated in order to correlate the two writing systems , culminating in the vienna literary agreement which has remained in service since the slovene language , not part of the serbo-croatian dialect continuum , was also covered by the same reform movement bengali : ishwar chandra vidyasagar removed archaic letters used for writing tatsama ( ৠ , ঌ , ৡ , ব ) and added three new letters ( ড় , ঢ় , য় ) to reflect contemporary bengali pronunciation in 1980 , w was recognized as a distinct letter korean : the hangul replaced hanja ideograms in the korean language it homogenized the spelling of and changed the adverbial and neuter adjectival ending -dt to -t or -tt depending on the length of the preceding vowel the phrase was now spelled anyway , there are some attempts to establish a standard orthography for venetian , like the grafia veneta unitaria ( '' shared venetian spelling '' ) , a spelling created by a committee convened by the region veneto in 1995 vietnamese : in the vietnamese language , the vietnamese alphabet replaced the earlier nom system in the 1920s .
