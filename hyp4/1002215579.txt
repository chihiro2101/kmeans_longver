colorado plattiary erosion landforms the mogollon rim escarpment is part of the transition zone between the mogollon plateau of the colorado plateau province and the sonoran desert of the basin and range province with the renewal of uplift by which the earlier cycle of erosion was interrupted and the present cycle introduced , inequalities of surface due to renewed faulting were again introduced such scarps are known as fault-line scarps , in distinction from the original fault scarps they are peculiar in having their altitude dependent on the depth of revived erosion , instead of the amount of faulting , and they are sometimes topographically reversed , in that the revived scarp overlooks a lowland worn on a weak formation in the upheaved fault-block a group of large volcanoes occurs on the limestone platform south of the grand canyon , culminating in humphreys peak , a moderately dissected cone , and associated with many more recent smaller cones and freshlooking lava flows mount taylor in western new mexico is of similar age , but here dissection seems to have advanced farther , probably because of the weaker nature of the underlying rocks the henry mountains in southwestern utah are peculiar in owing their relief to the doming or blistering up of the plateau strata by the underground intrusion of large bodies or cisterns ( laccolites ) of lava , now more or less exposed by erosion basin and range province the large basin and range province is a basin and range topography resulting from crustal extension ( extensional tectonics ) it is an arid region a few basins in the southeast have outlet by the rio grande to the gulf of mexico a much larger but still narrow medial area is drained southwestward by the colorado river to the head of the gulf of california , where this large and very turbid river has formed the extensive colorado river delta , north of which the former head of the gulf is now cut off from the sea and laid bare by evaporation as a plain below sea-level other examples are owens lake and mono lake in california during pleistocene times all these lacustrine basins were occupied by lakes of much greater depth and larger size in southeastern washington , eastern oregon , and southwestern idaho , and are known to be deep in some river gorges other parts of the lava flood are much older and have been more or less deformed and eroded one of the most remarkable features of the intermediate province is seen in the temporary course taken by the columbia river across the plains , while its canyon was obstructed by pleistocene glaciers that came from the cascade range on the northwest however they support wildlife , and cattle and horses
