kerogen is formed during sedimentary diagenesis from the degradation of living matter during diagenesis , large biopolymers from , e.g the formation of geopolymers in this way accounts for the large molecular weights and diverse chemical compositions associated with kerogen resulting changes in the burial temperatures and pressures lead to further changes in kerogen composition including loss of hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , and their associated functional groups , and subsequent isomerization and aromatization such changes are indicative of the thermal maturity state of kerogen kerogen is insoluble in normal organic solvents in part because of its high molecular mass of its component compounds & nbsp ; 150–200 & nbsp ; °c , both depending on how quickly the source rock is heated ) some types of kerogen release crude oil or natural gas , collectively known as hydrocarbons ( fossil fuels ) nmr experiments have found that carbon in kerogen can range from almost entirely aliphatic ( orbital hybridisation sp3 ) to almost entirely aromatic ( orbital hybridisation sp2 ) , with kerogens of higher thermal maturity typically having higher abundance of aromatic carbon another technique is raman spectroscopy similarly , sulfur speciation can be investigated with x-ray absorption near edge structure ( xanes ) spectroscopy , which is sensitive to sulfur-containing functional groups such as sulfides , thiophenes , and sulfoxides additional studies have explored the spatial heterogeneity of kerogen at small length scales measurements performed with atomic force microscopy coupled to infrared spectroscopy ( afm-ir ) and correlated with organic petrography have analyzed the evolution of the chemical composition and mechanical properties of individual macerals of kerogen with thermal maturation at the nanoscale example of a van krevelen diagram this kerogen is rich in lipid-derived material and is commonly , but not always , from algal organic matter in lacustrine ( freshwater ) environments type iv : inert/residual nationalconference of state legislatures hydrogen : carbon atomic ratio nakamura , t european association of organic geochemists organic geochemistry ( journal ) animation illustrating kerogene formation ( approx t 50s ) '' oil and gas formation '' youtube clip by earthscience westernaustralia
