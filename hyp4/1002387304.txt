zeno of elea ( 490 c aristotle took a majority of his examples for this from arithmetic and from geometry aristotle 's syllogistic logic , together with the axiomatic method exemplified by euclid 's elements , are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient greece platonism as a traditional philosophy of mathematics plato ( 424/423 & nbsp ; bc 348/347 & nbsp ; bc ) insisted that mathematical objects , like other platonic ideas ( forms or essences ) , must be perfectly abstract and have a separate , non-material kind of existence , in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans in the meno plato 's teacher socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval karlis podnieks , platonism , intuition and the nature of mathematics : 1 middle ages and renaissance rené descartes published la géométrie ( 1637 ) , aimed at reducing geometry to algebra by means of coordinate systems , giving algebra a more foundational role ( while the greeks embedded arithmetic into geometry by identifying whole numbers with evenly spaced points on a line ) the protestant philosopher george berkeley ( 1685–1753 ) , in his campaign against the religious implications of newtonian mechanics , wrote a pamphlet on the lack of rational justifications of infinitesimal calculus : the analyst , a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician '' they are neither finite quantities , nor quantities infinitely small , nor yet nothing but he did not formalize his notion of convergence this reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers , and thus of natural numbers , was later integrated by cantor in his set theory , and axiomatized in terms of second order arithmetic by hilbert and bernays in 1882 , lindemann building on the work of hermite showed that a straightedge and compass quadrature of the circle ( construction of a square equal in area to a given circle ) was also impossible by proving that is a transcendental number after many failed attempts to derive the parallel postulate from other axioms , the study of the still hypothetical hyperbolic geometry by johann heinrich lambert ( 1728–1777 ) led him to introduce the hyperbolic functions and compute the area of a hyperbolic triangle ( where the sum of angles is less than 180° ) as explained by russian historians : laptev , b.l english language versions of this process of deducing the properties of a field can be found in either the book by oswald veblen and john young , projective geometry ( 1938 ) , or more recently in john stillwell 's four pillars of geometry ( 2005 ) boolean algebra and logic its negation is provable ) frege 's work was popularized by bertrand russell near the turn of the century from 1890 to 1905 , ernst schröder published vorlesungen über die algebra der logik in three volumes several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century , as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes ( such as russell 's paradox ) a contradiction in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory ( such as , showing that this theory is inconsistent and must be rejected ( 2008 ) , '' brouwer , luitzen egbertus jan ( 1881–1966 ) '' , in biografisch woordenboek van nederland url : 2008-03-13 the fight was acrimonious as noted by weyl , formal logical systems also run the risk of inconsistency ; in peano axioms , this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency , but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitism to be meaningful gödel 's incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency logicism is a school of thought , and research programme , in the philosophy of mathematics , based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical ' in nature many researchers in axiomatic set theory have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic platonism , exemplified by kurt gödel several set theorists followed this approach and actively searched for axioms that may be considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the continuum hypothesis philosophical consequences of gödel 's completeness theorem hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions : the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory 1920 : thoralf skolem corrected leopold löwenheim 's proof of what is now called the downward löwenheim–skolem theorem , leading to skolem 's paradox discussed in 1922 , namely the existence of countable models of zf , making infinite cardinalities a relative property it showed how to construct , for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic on the ( infinite ) set of natural numbers a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability , which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory ; so that ( assuming the consistency as true ) , the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency , let alone that a simpler system could do the job 1936 : alfred tarski proved his truth undefinability theorem 1938 : gödel proved the constructible universe 1963 : paul cohen showed that the continuum hypothesis is unprovable from zfc toward resolution of the crisis his ambitions were expressed in a time when nothing was clear : it was not clear whether mathematics could have a rigorous foundation at all
