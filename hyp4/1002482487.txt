as the tumours progress , individuals with large numbers of tumours may become anaemic , have a lack of proteins and iron , and in more advanced stages even suffer from acidosis caused by imbalanced calcium/phosphorus ratios and severe emaciation today , incidences as high as 92 % have been reported in kaneohe bay , oahu , hawaii generally , fp is most prominent in warmer climates an alphaherpesvirus initially called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus ( fpthv ) , and now called chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 , is believed to be the causative agent of the disease the green sea turtle is an herbivore and feeds primarily on seagrass and macroalgae two toxins which are suspected to be associated with fp are found epiphytically on these plants this further supports the hypothesis of the herpesvirus as a causative agent surgical removal of tumors caused by fp is the most common treatment method even so , observations support the hypothesis that near-shore habitats have a strong correlation with the disease , as newly recruited individuals from the pelagic life phase have never been found with tumours , and when migrating to more shallow ocean zones , such as the neritic zone , individuals still remain free from fp , but when entering lagoon systems , turtles may become infected
