ordnance survey , 1:50,000 map at saxilby , the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway crosses the waterway , to run along the south bank all the way to lincoln the canal crosses under the a46 on the outskirts of lincoln , and then over a drainage ditch , to run alongside the carholme golf club the first record of it comes from symeon of durham , whose historia regium notes the following for the year 1121 : the canal is about long together with the car dyke it formed part an important transport route from peterborough to york the work was carried out by samuel fortrey , a man with previous experience of draining the fens under his son , the tolls were £2,367 in 1789 , while his grandson collected £5,159 in 1811 navigation through lincoln and on to boston was hampered by the shallow draught available under the medieval high bridge , just below brayford pool sir joseph banks , when proposing the construction of the horncastle canal knew that the problem needed addressing , and william jessop was commissioned to survey the witham and the foss dyke in 1791 , with particular reference to the junction between the two he proposed a bypass to the south of the city , using the sincil dyke , or excavating the channel beneath the bridge , although he recognized that this solution was not ideal , due to the narrow width of the bridge hole , and the lack of a towing path through it however , the city was keen to keep trade within its limits , and improvements to high bridge , which were completed by 1795 , were authorised as part of the horncastle canal act of 1792 a challenge to the legality of his lease was considered in the 1820s , but was not thought likely to succeed richard ellison iv had agreed a lease for 894 years , at £9,570 per year , based on the average profit for the previous three years plus 5 per cent although its date of construction is unknown , the london and north eastern railway ( successors of both the gnr and the gcr ) built a small pumping station to the west of torksey lock its job was to maintain the water levels in the navigation , but it was demolished in 1936 , and no traces of it remain when there is insufficient water in barlings eau and the witham , torksey pumping station transfers water from the trent through a short pipeline into foss dyke unlike many waterways , the foss dyke never closed , and continued to carry grain traffic until 1972 the route was officially opened on 26 july 2011
