the symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking , and then slowly abate , and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day , and may not be present on waking bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline hypersensitive teeth , ( e.g tenderness , pain or fatigue of the muscles of mastication , which may get worse during chewing or other jaw movement clicking of the temporomandibular joints the exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the bruxism occurs , e.g a tooth may become sore to bite on , and further , tooth wear may reduce the insulating width of enamel and dentin that protects the pulp of the tooth and result in hypersensitivity , e.g the relationship of bruxism with temporomandibular joint dysfunction ( tmd , or temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome ) is debated a systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism , there is a positive association with tmd pain , and when stricter diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used , the association with tmd symptoms is much lower in severe , chronic cases , bruxism can lead to myofascial pain and arthritis of the temporomandibular joints some of the muscles work to elevate the mandible ( close the mouth ) , and others also are involved in lateral ( side to side ) , protrusive or retractive movements bruxism can also be regarded as a disorder of repetitive , unconscious contraction of muscles this typically involves the masseter muscle and the anterior portion of the temporalis ( the large outer muscles that clench ) , and the lateral pterygoids , relatively small bilateral muscles that act together to perform sideways grinding
