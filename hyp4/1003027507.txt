the most remarkable feature of the aircraft was its engine '' the compressor , with a diameter of 50 & nbsp ; centimetres ( 20 & nbsp ; in ) , was located within a cowling at the front of the fuselage or a suction turbine the coandă-1910 was reportedly sold to charles weymann in october 1910 a daily newspaper from bucharest wrote in 1910 that the aircraft was constructed in clerget 's workshops and that it '' will fly in 6–7 weeks near paris , piloted by weymann , one of the pilots celebrated at the rennes aviation meeting at the exhibition , reaction among observers was mixed the tentative is interesting and we watch it closely '' with the help of despujols , a boat maker , and the motor manufacturer gregoire , coandă supervised the building of a motor sled , powered by a 30 & nbsp ;

he fitted them with dampeners and retraction mechanisms , the whole assembly being located inside aerodynamic pants with skids it appears that these successive revisions were only the result of coandă 's calculations or revisions filing date : 29 may 1911 the very expensive project of 1910 , costing coandă about one million francs , left him with limited funds the combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine , but coandă was unable to fund one at the military competition in reims in october 1911 , coandă displayed a large parasol wing with a wingspan , powered by two gnome rotary engines mounted laterally driving a single four-bladed propeller through an engine-coupling system also designed by coandă the machine was tested but was unable to fly high enough ( photograph of coandă 's 1911 aircraft with propeller at the beginning of the jet age , when the potential of reactive engines was recognised , several histories of the jet engine were written in the same year geoffrey g in the early 1950s coandă began to claim that he had flown his 1910 aircraft himself , and that the 1910 engine was the first motorjet , using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust antoniu ( 2010 ) , p paul johnston and early aviation curator louis casey in the 1980s after coandă 's death , stine wrote a magazine article and a book mentioning the 1910 aircraft , including new details such as the name of master mechanic pierre clerget as the friend who helped build the turbo-propulseur he wrote that '' although there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time—the 1910 coanda jet and the 1938 caproni campini n.1—the first pure jet aircraft flight was made in germany in 1938 '' in 1965 , historian emeritus paul e '' in this interview coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control , but the landing was '' abrupt '' and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame , the engine reduced to '' a few handfuls of white powder this fan was fitted right across the machine 's nose and the cowling covered the nose and part of the engine : the resulting 'jet ' of plain air was to propel the aeroplane he said that the airfield was the '' most famous , most used , most observed , and most reported-on 'airfield ' in paris '' , and that all events , let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire , would have been carried in local papers and described in military reports , but no contemporary accounts exist of the coandă-1910 being tested , flown or destroyed in 1970 gibbs-smith wrote another account of the coanda-1910 , using much the same phrasing as in 1960 : in 2010 , antoniu wrote that he thought gibbs-smith speculated on the basis of the evidence of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown , but that gibbs-smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position antoniu also wrote that gibbs-smith did not check the french patents claimed by coandă in 1910 and 1911 , describing the retractable gear , leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank , and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote 2 machine of 1911 preparing for flight before the reims military competition of 21 october 1911 , pilot boutiny sits in the cockpit ( michel marani collection ) '' in 1980 , nasm historian frank h . after coandă 's death christy & leroy ( 1994 ) , pp it was equipped with what today might be called an afterburner , producing an estimated 500 & nbsp ;
