the canal ran broadly north , following closely the course of the river itself , for a distance of , terminating at moorswater , in the valley to the west of liskeard there is a short branch of about a mile in length to sand place priestley incorporates a number of inaccuracies into his description : he has taken the number of locks from the authorising act ; in fact there were twenty-four there was a wharf at sandplace ( sand place ) but it was immediately adjacent to the main line of the canal ; messenger points out that a quay was dug into the river bank at sandplace to serve a kiln , and priestley was misled into thinking that this was a branch of the canal ; actually it was the main river the project was estimated to cost £17,495 , which would be recouped in seven years , based on expected income , but the scheme was not progressed the rise of 180 & nbsp ; feet in in 10 & nbsp ; km ) threatened water supply difficulties if negotiated by locks , so green repeated the earlier proposal for two inclined planes '' however priestley does not offer this as a direct quotation from the act , and he may have heard this reported from an earlier , unsuccessful bill , and mistakenly understood the plan to be still current work on building the canal began on 6 september 1825 , with robert coad as the engineer and robert retallick as superintendent of works traffic immediately transferred to this road from the steep and inconvenient turnpike road ( '' old road '' ) and the canal company demanded a subscription for maintenance from the turnpike trustees the canal vastly increased the facility of bringing lime and sea sand to the agricultural hinterland above liskeard ; in addition coal was brought for lime burning and for domestic use the company watched expenditure carefully , but managed to pay a dividend of 6 per cent in 1830 and 5 per cent thereafter for most of the canal 's life mineral extraction on caradon mineral ore could now be brought relatively conveniently to market : by railway to moorswater ; by canal boat to looe ; and onwards by coastal shipping some limited statistics have survived : in 1849 , 21,713 tons were carried , of which 7,546 tons were copper ore , and 6,175 tons were coal ; in 1859 , 48,193 tons were carried , of which 17,361 tons were copper ore and 15,712 tons were coal , as well as 8,297 tons of granite proposals for a railway attention was given to constructing a railway from moorswater to looe although there was some opposition from buller 's son , also called john , and from the admiralty , who were concerned about navigation on the river , the duchy of cornwall helped the company to obtain its authorising act of parliament , the liskeard and looe railway act , which was granted on 11 may 1858 it authorised the canal company to raise additional capital of £13,000 in £25 shares , with authority to borrow £4,000 the canal after the railway sandplace continued to be a significant wharf for the canal , due to the activities of john buller , but it appears that the canal above that point , although not actually displaced by the railway construction , was positively allowed to decline between 1901 and 1909 , the annual gross dues averaged 35 shillings ( £1.75 ) , mainly derived from tolls of 3 pence ( 1.25p ) for small boats of about 1.5 tons carrying sand and seaweed , which was used to improve the land ordnance survey , 1:2500 map , 1882 canals of great britain history of the british canal system
