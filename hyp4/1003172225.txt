the word fynbos is often confusingly said to mean '' fine bush '' in afrikaans , as '' bos '' means '' bush '' '' he also refers to a high degree of endemism in the grasses in that region applied by the inhabitants of the cape to any sort of small woodland growth that does not include timber trees '' ; in the current vernacular , this still is the effective sense of the word fynbos – which grows in a 100-to-200-km-wide coastal belt stretching from clanwilliam on the west coast to port elizabeth on the southeast coast – forms part of the cape floral kingdom , where it accounts for half of the surface area and 80 % of the plant species the fynbos in the western regions is richer and more varied than in the eastern regions of south africa growing nowhere else in the world thus , although the fynbos covers only 6 % of the area of southern africa , it has half the species on the subcontinent – and in fact has almost 1 in 5 of all african plant species so far described restionaceae also occur in greater variety in fynbos than anywhere else ; their species are superficially grass-like the flora of the lowlands contains a high number of endemic species , and tends to favour larger plants than those growing on the hillier areas particular types of lowland fynbos include the shrubs and herbs of the coastal sand dunes , the mixture of ericoids and restoids with thickets of shrubs such as maytenus , and other celastraceae , sideroxylons and other sapotaceae , and rhus and other anacardiaceae on the coastal sands ; the classic fynbos of the sandplains of the west coast forelands , and the agulhas plain ; the grassy fynbos of the hillier and wetter areas of the south and south-eastern coast forelands ; areas where fynbos and renosterveld are mixed ; coastal renosterveld on the west and south coast forelands ; and the inland renosterveld of the drier inland little karoo and warm bokkeveld the same level of floral variety , including all three characteristic fynbos families , is found there , but ericas predominate many of these birds and insects are important and specific pollinators for the fynbos , such as the mountain pride butterfly ( aeropetes tulbaghia ) which only visits red flowers such as disa uniflora and pollinates 15 different species larger animals include antelopes , particularly cape grysbok ( raphicerus melanotis ) , common duiker ( sylvicapra grimmia ) , and klipspringer ( oreotragus oreotragus ) in 1997 it was estimated that invasion caused the fynbos region to decline in value by us 750 million per year
