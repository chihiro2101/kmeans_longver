( first generation ) step two : repeat the following regenerational steps until termination : evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population ( time limit , sufficient fitness achieved , etc this type of ea is often used in optimization problems gene expression programming – like genetic programming , gep also evolves computer programs but it explores a genotype-phenotype system , where computer programs of different sizes are encoded in linear chromosomes of fixed length evolution strategy – works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions , and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates a possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype-phenotype distinction proceedings of the ieee congress on evolutionary computing special section on evolutionary robotics , 2009 ofria , and r swarm algorithms include ant colony optimization – based on the ideas of ant foraging by pheromone communication to form paths primarily proposed for numerical optimization and extended to solve combinatorial , constrained and multi-objective optimization problems other population-based metaheuristic methods , kazemzadeh azad , s harmony search – based on the ideas of musicians ' behavior in searching for better harmonies this algorithm is suitable for combinatorial optimization as well as parameter optimization gif a two-population ea search over a constrained rosenbrock function with bounded global optimum file : two-population ea search ( 3 )
