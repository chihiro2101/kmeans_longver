the venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein lymphatically , the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes , the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes , and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes at this point it passes through the diaphragm these constrictions are : at the start of the esophagus , where the laryngopharynx joins the esophagus , behind the cricoid cartilage where it is crossed on the front by the aortic arch in the superior mediastinum where the esophagus is compressed by the left main bronchus in the posterior mediastinum the esophageal hiatus where it passes through the diaphragm in the posterior mediastinum these sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed the upper esophageal sphincter is an anatomical sphincter , which is formed by lower portion of inferior pharyngeal constrictor , also known as cricopharyngeal sphincter due to its relation with cricoid cartilage of the larynx anteriorly the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk normally , the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line and the z-line coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia ; however , when the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in barrets esophagus the true gastro-eshophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition there are two types of glands , with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa , and esophageal cardiac glands , similar to cardiac glands of the stomach , located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ the muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle the ventral part of the embryo abuts the yolk sac the sac is surrounded by a network of vitelline arteries the stomach produces gastric acid , a strongly acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion the acute angle of his and the lower crura of the diaphragm also help this sphincteric action . gene and protein expression about 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells and nearly 70 % of these genes are expressed in the normal esophagus gerd of gastric acids from the stomach , infection , substances ingested ( for example , corrosives ) , some medications ( such as bisphosphonates ) , and food allergies can all lead to esophagitis in this condition , there is metaplasia of the lining of the lower esophagus , which changes from stratified squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia this type is much more common in china and iran in its early stages , esophageal cancer may not have any symptoms at all other strictures may include esophageal webs ( which can also be congenital ) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy , corrosive ingestion , or eosinophilic esophagitis two of the most common congenital malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the esophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach ; and an esophageal fistula â€“ an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea these are found in about 1 in 3500 births the other cases occur singly if an endoscopy is used on the stomach , the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus the use of the word oesophagus , has been documented in anatomical literature since at least the time of hippocrates , who noted that '' the oesophagus & nbsp ; receives the greatest amount of what we consume by 1908 , an operation had been performed by voeckler to remove the esophagus , and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus , ( to control esophageal cancer ) , had been conducted in the majority of vertebrates , the esophagus is simply a connecting tube , but in some birds , which regurgitate components to feed their young , it is extended towards the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach in ruminants , animals with four stomachs , a groove called the sulcus reticuli is often found in the esophagus , allowing milk to drain directly into the hind stomach , the abomasum the esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from the condition known as choke it is entirely smooth muscle in amphibians , reptiles and birds contrary to popular belief , an adult human body would not be able to pass through the esophagus of a whale , which generally measures less than in diameter , although in larger baleen whales it may be up to when fully distended in the freshwater snail species tarebia granifera , the brood pouch is above the esophagus
