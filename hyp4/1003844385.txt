a number of post-processualists , such as michael shanks , christopher tilley and peter ucko , undermined '' archaeology 's claims to be an authoritative source of knowledge about the past '' , thereby '' encouraging people to question and resist all forms of authority… this position was hailed by its supporters as democratizing archaeology and purging it… of elitist pretensions '' whereas the processualists had been firm materialists , and the culture-historical archaeology had , by contrast , been idealists , the post-processualists argued that past societies should be interpreted through both materialist and idealist ideas pearson , mike parker they suggest that ancient peoples would have had different views of what was 'real ' in that landscape structuralism itself was a theory developed by the french anthropologist claude lévi-strauss ( 1908–2009 ) , and held to the idea that '' cultural patterns need not be caused by anything outside themselves… and that underlying every culture was a deep structure , or essence , governed by its own laws , that people were unaware of but which ensured regularities in the cultural productions that emanate from it in turn , by bending the societal rules , these rules eventually change a minority of post-processualists , such as julian thomas have however argued that human agency is not a useful aspect for looking at past societies , thereby accepting a cultural determinism position although it would not be actually termed '' post-processual archaeology '' until 1985 ( by one of its most prominent proponents , ian hodder ) , an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s bruce trigger , a canadian archaeologist who produced a seminal study of archaeological theory , identified there as being three main influences upon post-processualism having originated among the disciplines of comparative literature , literary criticism and cultural studies , postmodernist thinking had begun to develop within archaeology the new cultural anthropologists '' denounced studies of cultural evolution as being ethnocentric and intellectually and morally untenable in a multicultural , postcolonial environment most prominent among these was ian hodder ( born 1948 ) , a former processualist who had made a name for himself for his economic analysis of spatial patterns and early development of simulation studies , particularly relating to trade , markets and urbanization in iron age and roman britain in effect , he came to believe that even using the processual approach to understanding archaeological data , there were still many different ways that that data could be interpreted , and that therefore radically different conclusions could be put forward by different archaeologists , despite processualism 's claim that using the scientific method it could gain objective fact from the archaeological record . development in the united states many american archaeologists also began to take note of a gender bias in the archaeological interpretation and in the discipline as a whole , as women had been largely marginalised earle and robert w
