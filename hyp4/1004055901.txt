for articles containing plain text , this is synonymous with an article overviews make reading a newsgroup faster for both the client and server by eliminating the need to open each individual article to present them in list form among the operators and users of commercial news servers , common concerns are the continually increasing storage and network capacity requirements and their effects speed , in relation to usenet , is how quickly a server can deliver an article to the user how fast the data can move throughout this farm is the first thing that affects the speed of delivery retrieving the article and overview information can cause massive stress on hard drives to combat this , caching technology and cylindrical file storage systems have been developed article sizes are limited to what each news server will accept this generally means that a server can run with less overhead which makes for a more efficient server , but gives less articles for users to access retention is generally quoted separately for text and binary articles , though it may also vary between different groups within these categories large news providers offer text retention up to 2480 days and binary retention of 850 days or more this is a particular problem to binary newsgroups which transmit large volumes of articles given the large number of articles transferred between servers and the large size of individual articles , their complete propagation to any one server farm is not guaranteed looking at only one server , one can not know how many articles were actually inserted throughout the network because message-id : headers are nominally unique throughout the network , comparison of the lists is mostly a straightforward task there are several common ways in which the spool may be organized : one file per article is the oldest storage scheme , still in common use on smaller servers and replicated in many clients its performance capability is a direct function of the underlying operating system 's ability to create , remove and locate files within a directory , and often this scheme is insufficient to keep up with modern usenet traffic most servers can provide both functions modern transit servers usually use nntp to exchange news continually over the internet and similar always-on connections articles are routed based on information found in the header lines defined in rfc 1036 the sender transmits matching articles ' message-ids to the receiving server articles with control lines are given special handling the newgroup and rmgroup commands can cause newsgroups to be created or removed ; checkgroups can be used to reconcile the local active list with a commonly accepted set ; and cancel commands are used to request the deletion of a specific article reader servers typically also maintain a news overview ( nov ) database that allows newsreaders to quickly obtain message summaries and present messages in threaded form . hybrid or cache server
