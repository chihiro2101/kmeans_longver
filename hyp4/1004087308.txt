( if not , exchange red and blue in what follows thus r ( 3 , 3 ) & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6 consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex v this is called the red neighbourhood of v thus , the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of v has edges coloured with only two colours , namely green and blue it is known that there are exactly two edge colourings with 3 colours on k 15 that avoid monochromatic triangles , which can be constructed by deleting any vertex from the untwisted and twisted colourings on k 16 , respectively this starts the induction we prove that exists by finding an explicit bound for it pick a vertex from the graph , and partition the remaining vertices into two sets and , such that for every vertex , is in if is blue , and is in if is red it is also possible to define ramsey numbers for directed graphs ; these were introduced by . relationship to the axiom of choice in reverse mathematics , there is a significant difference in proof strength between the version of ramsey 's theorem for infinite graphs ( the case n 2 ) and for infinite multigraphs ( the case n ≥ 3 ) the electronic journal of combinatorics dynamic survey of small ramsey numbers ( by stanisław radziszowski ) ramsey number – from mathworld ( contains lower and upper bounds up to r ( 19 , 19 ) ) ramsey number – geoffrey exoo ( contains r ( 5 , 5 ) > 42 counter-proof )
