cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors the most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids , particularly thc another psychoactive cannabinoid present in cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabivarin ( thcv ) , but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist . biochemical mechanisms in the brain . sustainability in the body '' it 's honestly hell according to the merck index , 1996 the merck index , 12th ed it is important though to note that cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs , especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes cyp450 , cannabinoids and cytochrome p450 interactions however , other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco , and that some other constituents ( such as polonium-210 , lead , arsenic , nicotine , and tobacco-specific nitrosamines ) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke these include nitrosamines , reactive aldehydes , and polycylic hydrocarbons , including benzapyrene in some cases , cannabis can lead to acute psychosis and dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization some of the short-term physical effects of cannabis use include increased heart rate , dry mouth , reddening of the eyes ( congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels ) , a reduction in intra-ocular pressure , muscle relaxation and a sensation of cold or hot hands and feet and / or flushed face cannabinoids produce a '' marked depression of motor activity '' via activation of neuronal cannabinoid receptors belonging to the cb1 subtype when taken orally ( in the form of capsules , food , or drink ) , the psychoactive effects take longer to manifest and generally last longer , typically lasting for an average of four to six hours after consumption in cannabis and driving : a review of the literature and commentary , the united kingdom 's department for transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving , finding although impaired , '' subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired where they can compensate , they do there were about 50 confirmed cases from 1960 to 2008 , all of which occurred in europe such complications demonstrate the need for studies on cannabis that have stronger controls , and investigations into alleged symptoms of cannabis use that may also be caused by tobacco some critics question whether agencies doing the research make an honest effort to present an accurate , unbiased summary of the evidence , or whether they '' cherry-pick '' their data to please funding sources which may include the tobacco industry or governments dependent on cigarette tax revenue ; others caution that the raw data , and not the final conclusions , are what should be examined the australian national household survey of 2001 aihw cat no studies on cannabis and memory are hindered by small sample sizes , confounding drug use , and other factors the strongest evidence regarding cannabis and memory focuses on its temporary negative effects on short-term and working memory on his studies regarding cannabis use , lead researcher and harvard professor harrison pope said he found marijuana is not dangerous over the long term , but there are short-term effects it is widely accepted that the neonatal survival of many species '' is largely dependent upon their suckling behavior , or appetite for breast milk '' and recent research has identified the endogenous cannabinoid system to be the first neural system to display complete control over milk ingestion and neonatal survival it is possible that '' cannabinoid receptors in our body interact with the cannabinoids in milk to stimulate a suckling response in newborns so as to prevent growth failure '' the fungi aspergillus flavus , aspergillus fumigatus , aspergillus niger , aspergillus parasiticus , aspergillus tamarii , aspergillus sulphureus , aspergillus repens , mucor hiemalis ( not a human pathogen ) , penicillium chrysogenum , penicillium italicum and rhizopus nigricans have been found in moldy cannabis mold is also found in smoke from mold-infected cannabis , and the lungs and nasal passages are a major means of contracting fungal infections such drugs include bupropion , divalproex , nefazodone , lofexidine , and dronabinol cannabis smoking psychoactive drug cannabis use and psychosis from national drug and alcohol research centre , australia provision of marijuana and other compounds for scientific research recommendations of the national institute on drug abuse national advisory council scientific american magazine ( december 2004 issue ) the brain 's own marijuana ramstr√∂m , j canberra : australian government publishing service ; 1994
