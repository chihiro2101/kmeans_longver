design work began in 1953 at okb-1 in kaliningrad in moscow oblast ( presently korolyov , moscow oblast ) and other divisions with the requirement for a two-stage missile of with a range of and the maximum speed of 20 mach carrying a warhead in 1954 , the draft project was completed because of clustered design , each booster had its own propellant tanks the rocket had some key features to it that made it unique of the four strap on propulsion engines , they were all powered by the rd-107 engine the first flight-ready vehicle was delivered to the baikonur cosmodrome on 1 may 1957 , and flown on 15 may the next icbm test took place on 30 january 1958 , but the strap-ons failed to separate cleanly and damaged plumbing in the core stage , which lost thrust and impacted far off target the additional development resulted in the 8k74 ( also known as r-7a ) , which was lighter , had better navigation systems , more powerful engines , extended its range to by carrying more fuel , and increased payload to aside from the initial sputnik launches , the 8k71 formed the basis of the 8k72 booster used for the first generation luna probes ; r-7 semyorka : first launch 15 may 1957 , last launch 27 february 1961 ; 27 launch attempts , 18 of which were successful ; : the strategic missile troops was the only operator of the semyorka the kremlin 's nuclear sword , steven j zaloga , smithsonian institution press , washington and london , 2002
