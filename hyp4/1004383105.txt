the period 's s-block metals put their differentiating electron onto 4s having vacancies among nominally lower states & nbsp ; â€“ a phenomenon unseen in lighter elements : ( ) exception to the madelung rule potassium ( k ) is an alkali metal , placed under sodium and over rubidium , and is the first element of period 4 potassium has a relatively low melting point ; it will melt just by putting it under a small open flame chromium also has many colorful compounds , and as such is very commonly used in pigments , such as chrome green manganese ( mn ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 7 manganese is often found in combination with iron manganese is also poisonous ; if enough is inhaled , it can cause irreversible neurological damage iron is the most common on earth among elements of the period , and probably the most well-known of them cobalt is also a core component of many magnetic and high-strength alloys the only stable isotope , cobalt-59 , is an important component of vitamin b-12 , while cobalt-60 is a component of nuclear fallout and can be dangerous in large enough quantities due to its radioactivity arsenic , as mentioned above , is often used in semiconductors in alloys with germanium selenium is quite rare in pure form in nature , mostly being found in minerals such as pyrite , and even then it is quite rare selenium is a calcogen but it is metallic gray in its crystalline structure bromine ( br ) is an element in halogen bromine is also quite toxic and corrosive , but bromide ions , which are relatively inert , can be found in halite , or table salt krypton ( kr ) is a noble gas , placed under argon and over xenon krypton , like most noble gases , is also used in lighting because of its many spectral lines and the aforementioned reasons vanabins , also known as vanadium-associated proteins , are found in the blood cells of some species of ascidiacea the most famous example of this is heme : an iron-containing porphyrin compound responsible for the oxygen-carrying function of myoglobin and hemoglobin as well as the catalytic activity of cytochrome p450
