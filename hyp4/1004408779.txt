( see also stress in standard chinese ) stressed syllables are often perceived as being more forceful than non-stressed syllables languages in which the position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have fixed stress in quechua , esperanto , and polish , the stress is almost always on the penult ( second-last syllable ) other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way , as in classical arabic and latin , where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables french words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable , but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable ( unless it is a schwa , when stress is placed on the second-last syllable ) of any string of words in that language for example , english , russian , italian , portuguese and spanish '' to paraphrase '' ) ; and italian '' anchor '' vs '' more , still , yet '' ) , '' lock '' ) ; and in portuguese , such as the triplet , '' wise woman '' ) , , '' knew '' ) , , '' thrush '' ) for instance , the english word laboratory is stressed on the second syllable in british english ( labóratory often pronounced '' labóratry '' , the second o being silent ) , but the first syllable in american english , with a secondary stress on the '' tor ' syllable ( láboratory often pronounced '' lábratory '' ) the portuguese words for madagascar and the continent oceania are stressed on the third syllable in european portuguese and , but on the fourth syllable in brazilian portuguese and and even such exceptions , for example mankínd , mankind in the collins english dictionary are instead often stressed on the first component by some people or in some kinds of english ladefoged ( 1975 etc it may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language , but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance ( contrastive stress ) a similar pattern is found in english ( see above ) : the traditional distinction between ( lexical ) primary and secondary stress is replaced partly by a prosodic rule stating that the final stressed syllable in a phrase is given additional stress ( a word spoken alone becomes such a phrase , hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases . stress and vowel reduction that behavior is not confined to verbs ; note for example spanish '' wind '' from latin , or italian '' fire '' from latin númi ) and key '' 2 '' with the other ( e.g a trial may be from 2 to 6 stimuli in length spelling and notation for stress ( the acute accent is also used on some monosyllables in order to distinguish homographs , as in ( '' the '' ) and ( '' or '' ) ; here the stress of the two words is the same if the last syllable is stressed , the accent mark is used if the word ends in the letters n , s , or a vowel , as in a form of the pronoun ; '' where '' as a pronoun or wh-complement , '' where '' as an adverb ) some of these are listed here some pre-revolutionary dictionaries , e.g compare ( deterioration ) and ( back exit ) that mark is usually used in books by the academy of the hebrew language and is available on the standard hebrew keyboard at altgr-6
