guderian was born in kulm , west prussia ( now poland ) , on 17 june 1888 , the son of friedrich and clara ( née kirchhoff ) in november 1914 , he was promoted to first lieutenant early in 1919 , guderian was selected as one of the four thousand officers allowed by the versailles treaty in the reduced-size german army , the reichswehr in the resulting work guderian mixed academic lectures , a review of military history and armored warfare theory that partly relied on a 1934 book on the subject by ludwig von eimannsberger lutz was dismissed and replaced by guderian during august 1939 guderian took command of the newly formed xix army corps under his corps command was one of germany 's six panzer divisions ; guderian 's corps controlled 14.5 per cent of germany 's armoured fighting vehicles guderian had accomplished his first operational victory and he gave a tour of the battlefield to hitler and heinrich himmler , head of the ss on 16 september , guderian launched an attack on brest litovsk ; the next day the soviet union invaded poland at the conclusion of the campaign , guderian was awarded a knight 's cross of the iron cross invasion of france and the low countries a british counter-attack at arras on 21 may slowed down the german advance and allowed bef to establish defenses around points of evacuation , while hitler , conscious of potential reverses and of allowing unsupported armor into urban fighting , issued the order to halt invasion of the soviet union however , during the planning for operation barbarossa , the german invasion of the soviet union , he had become optimistic about the supposed superiority of german arms following the conclusion of the battle of smolensk , which ended with the encirclement and destruction of the soviet 16th , 19th and 20th armies , general franz halder , chief-of-staff of the okh , argued in favor of the all-out drive toward moscow owing to the 2nd panzer group 's southward turn during the battle , the wehrmacht destroyed the entire southwestern front east of kiev , inflicting over 600,000 losses on the red army by 26 september guderian demanded an inquiry into the realities of tank warfare on the eastern front , eventually suggesting in november to senior german tank designers and manufacturers that the quickest solution was to produce a direct copy of the soviet t-34 tank in the aftermath of the battle , guderian blamed slow commitment of 4th army to the attack for the german failure to reach moscow in the aftermath of the german failure , guderian refused to pass on hitler 's 'stand fast ' order and fell out with kluge , the new commander of the army group centre inspector general of armoured troops guderian opposed the offensive whenever i think of this attack , my stomach turns over guderian became the acting chief of the general staff of the army high command with the responsibility of advising hitler on the eastern front post-war , guderian claimed that he had attempted to get out of this duty and that he had found the sessions '' repulsive '' in reality , guderian had applied himself to the task with vigour of a nazi adherent , which perhaps was due to the desire to deflect attention from himself hart writes that he fought to save rommel 's chief of staff , hans speidel , because speidel could have implicated guderian in the plot even with vacancies filling up , a key problem remained : too many of the personnel were new to their roles and lacked institutional knowledge , including guderian himself after the war , guderian blamed hitler for frittering away the last german reserves in the operation ; nonetheless , germany 's strategic situation was such that even twenty or thirty extra divisions would not have helped he also made the nazi salute obligatory throughout the armed forces this was supposedly the rationale behind guderian 's plans to turn major urban centers along the eastern front into so-called fortress cities ( feste plätze ) he had an exclusive dinner with himmler on christmas day 1944 despite the general 's later claims of being anti-nazi , hitler most likely found guderian 's values to be closely aligned with nazi ideology later life and death he joined the us army historical division in 1945 and the us refused requests from the soviet union to have him extradited many of his peers were not so lucky in 1952 guderian 's memoirs were reprinted in english he was one of a number of innovators he stood out from his arguably more able compatriot , lutz , for two reasons in portraying himself as the father of blitzkrieg and ingratiating himself with the americans he avoided being handed over to the soviet union his memoirs omitted mention of his military failings and his close relationship with hitler james corum writes in his book the roots of blitzkrieg : hans von seeckt and german military reform that guderian was an excellent general , a first-rate tactician and a man who played a central role in developing panzer divisions , irrespective of his memoirs myth of the clean wehrmacht he also played a large role in the commission of reprisals after the warsaw uprising of 1944 like other generals , guderian 's memoirs emphasized his loyalty to germany and the german people ; however , he neglected to mention that hitler bought this loyalty with bribes , including landed estates and a monthly payment of 2,000 reichsmarks the occupants had been evicted kann westeuropa verteidigt werden ? translation into russian ( можно ли защитить западную европу ? ) while also writing that the defendants executed at the nuremberg trials ( for war crimes such as the holocaust ) were '' defenders of europe '' ronald smelser and edward j he also lied about the barbarossa decree that preemptively exempted german troops from prosecution for crimes committed against soviet civilians , claiming that it was never carried out either the favourable descriptions started with the british journalist and military theorist liddell hart , who described guderian as one of the '' great captains of history '' , in a book published by the mass-market ballantine books in 1957 the reviews stressed the separation between the professional soldiers and the nazi regime , while the new york times book review described the book as one of the best written by former german generals originally published in german , titled erinnerungen eines soldaten ( memories of a soldier ) , heidelberg 1950 ;
