gases released are discharged through the exhaust system after the incineration is completed , the dry bone fragments are swept out of the retort and pulverised by a machine called a cremulator—essentially a high-capacity , high-speed blender—to process them into '' ashes '' or '' cremated remains '' , '' cremulator '' is a trademark of dwf europe ) after final grinding , the ashes are placed in a container , which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative urn cremated remains are mostly dry calcium phosphates with some minor minerals , such as salts of sodium and potassium because many changes in body composition ( such as fat and muscle loss or gain ) do not affect the weight of cremated remains , the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person 's height and sex ( which predicts skeletal weight ) , than it can be predicted from the person 's simple weight not all that remains is bone eisenberg , the scoop on breasts : a plastic surgeon busts the myths , incompra press , 2012 , some medical devices such as pacemakers may need to be removed before cremation to avoid the risk of explosion large items such as titanium hip replacements ( which tarnish but do not melt ) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing , as they may damage the processor ( if they are missed at first , they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete , as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground cremated remains may also be incorporated , with urn and cement , into part of an artificial reef , or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased a portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry , or even blown into special glass keepsakes and glass orbs ashes are mildly acidic ) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river ganges , preferably at one of the holy cities triveni sangam , allahabad , varanasi , or haridwar in india the thought of a long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some ; many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body instantly sublette & flagg , p generally speaking , cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service , especially if direct cremation is chosen , in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes ( usually less than 1 part in 1000 , because of cost constraints ) scattered in space ( known as space burial and offered by companies such as elysium space , celestis and ascending memories ) studies by elisabeth keijzer for the netherlands organisation for applied research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial ( the study did not address natural burials ) , while the newer method of alkaline hydrolysis ( sometimes called green cremation or resomation ) had less impact than both '' society & animals 19.3 ( 2011 ) : 248–260 the american humane society 's cost for cremation of 22.5 & nbsp ;
