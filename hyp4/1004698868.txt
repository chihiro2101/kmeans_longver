using triangulation , the two directions can be plotted on a map where their intersection reveals the location of the navigator at most angles the loop has a fairly flat reception pattern , but when it is aligned perpendicular to the station the signal received on one side of the loop cancels the signal in the other , producing a sharp drop in reception known as the '' null '' a smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna , but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult as the antenna rotated through a fixed position , typically due north , the antenna was keyed with the morse code signal of the station 's identification letters so the receiver could ensure they were listening to the right station the modern vor system is based on the same principles ( see below ) the vor station transmits two audio signals on a vhf carrier – one is at 1020 & nbsp ; hz which is morse code to identify the station , the other is a continuous 9960 & nbsp ; hz audio signal frequency modulated at 30 & nbsp ; hz , with the 0-degree referenced to magnetic north in the post-world war i era , the lorenz company of germany developed a means of projecting two narrow radio signals with a slight overlap in the center although there was some interest in deploying a medium-range system like the us lff , deployment had not yet started when the beam system was combined with the orfordness timing concepts to produce the highly accurate sonne system in the immediate pre-world war ii era the same concept was also developed as a blind-bombing system and other countries , until the advent of the vor in the late 1940s if the pilot deviated to either side the '' a '' or '' n '' tone would become louder and the pilot knew to make a correction at its peak deployment , there were over 400 lfr stations in the us . glide path and the localizer of ils the remaining widely used beam systems are glide path and the localizer of the instrument landing system ( ils ) ils can provide enough accuracy and redundancy to allow automated landings navigation systems based on these concepts soon appeared , and remained in widespread use until recently the same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator 's station , which is equipped with an oscilloscope transponders are a combination of receiver and transmitter whose operation is automated – upon reception of a particular signal , normally a pulse on a particular frequency , the transponder sends out a pulse in response , typically delayed by some very short time transponder-based distance-distance navigation systems have a significant advantage in terms of positional accuracy this allows these systems to remain accurate over very long range the first distance-based navigation system was the german y-gerät blind-bombing system to ease pilot workload only one of these was used for navigation – prior to the mission a circle was drawn over the target from one of the stations , and the aircraft was directed to fly along this circle on instructions from the ground operator the signals were then examined on existing gee display units in the aircraft ( see below ) the asv radar introduced by raf coastal command was designed to track down submarines and ships by displaying the signal from two antennas side by side and allowing the operator to compare their relative strength the british put this concept to use in their rebecca/eureka system , where battery-powered '' eureka '' transponders were triggered by airborne '' rebecca '' radios and then displayed on asv mk in the post-war era , a general navigation system using transponder-based systems was deployed as the distance measuring equipment ( dme ) system the difference in timing between the two signals would reveal them to be along a curve of possible locations by making similar measurements with other stations , additional lines of position can be produced , leading to a fix gee was accurate to about 165 & nbsp ; yards ( 150 & nbsp ; m ) at short ranges , and up to a mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) at longer ranges over germany by 1962 , high-power loran-c was in place in at least 15 countries jansky & baily 1962 , pp.23–37 these systems determined pulse timing not by comparison of two signals , but by comparison of a single signal with a local atomic clock these are essentially hyperbolic '' existence and uniqueness of gps solutions '' , j.s chaffee '' , b.t fang , ieee transactions on aerospace and electronic systems , vol systems whose transmitters are in orbits by measuring signal times of arrival ( toas ) from at least four satellites , the user 's receiver can re-build an accurate clock signal of its own and allows hyperbolic navigation to be carried out loran , omega , decca , consol and many other systems disappeared during the 1990s and 2000s radionavigation service ( short : rns ) is – according to article 1.42 of the international telecommunication union ( itu ) radio regulations ( rr ) itu radio regulations , section iv primary allocation : is indicated by writing in capital letters secondary allocation : is indicated by small letters exclusive or shared utilization : is within the responsibility of administrations ;
