whereas modern interframe video formats , such as mpeg1 , mpeg2 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc , achieve real-world compression ratios of 1:50 or better , m-jpeg 's lack of interframe prediction limits its efficiency to 1:20 or lower , depending on the tolerance to spatial artifacting in the compressed output jpeg is inefficient , using more bits to deliver similar quality , compared to more modern formats ( such as jpeg 2000 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc ) it tolerates rapidly changing motion in the video stream , whereas compression schemes using interframe compression can often experience unacceptable quality loss when the video content changes significantly between each frame unlike the video formats specified in international standards such as mpeg-2 and the format specified in the jpeg still-picture coding standard , there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of “ motion jpeg ” for use in all contexts modern desktop cpus are powerful enough to work with high-definition video , so no special hardware is required , and they in turn offer native random-access to any frame avi extension with a resolution of 480×272 recent firmware updates to the nintendo 3ds can now record and play '' 3d-avi '' m-jpeg-encoded files , which is the same format used in the fujifilm finepix real 3d series , from a sd card in 320×240 resolution so long as the video duration is 10 minutes or less for cameras that do n't provide this feature natively , a server can be used to transcode the camera pictures into an m-jpeg stream and then provide that stream to other network clients in response to a get request for a mjpeg file or stream , the server streams the sequence of jpeg frames over http a special mime-type content type multipart/x-mixed-replace ; boundary informs the client to expect several parts ( frames ) as an answer delimited by two basic implementations of a m-jpeg streaming server are cambozola and mjpg-streamer other browsers , such as internet explorer can display m-jpeg streams with the help of external plugins m-jpeg is also natively supported by playstation and quicktime
