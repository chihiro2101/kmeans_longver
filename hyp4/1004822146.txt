thermal energy is the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter this results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields , resulting in the emission of photons , radiating energy away from the body the ratio of any body 's emission relative to that of a black body is the body 's emissivity , so that a black body has an emissivity of unity ( i.e absorptivity , reflectivity , and emissivity of all bodies are dependent on the wavelength of the radiation for example , the white paint in the diagram to the right is highly reflective to visible light ( reflectivity about 0.80 ) , and so appears white to the human eye due to reflecting sunlight , which has a peak wavelength of about 0.5 micrometers at any given temperature , there is a frequency f max at which the power emitted is a maximum the photosphere of the sun , at a temperature of approximately 6000 & nbsp ; k , emits radiation principally in the ( human- ) visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transfer in both directions ; an example of this is the multi-layer insulation used to insulate spacecraft , for cooling photovoltaic cells and buildings fabrics for personalized cooling applications have been proposed that enable infrared transmission to directly pass through clothing , while being opaque at visible wavelengths , allowing the wearer to remain cooler there are 4 main properties that characterize thermal radiation ( in the limit of the far field ) : thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies this is determined by wien 's displacement law in the diagram the peak value for each curve moves to the left as the temperature increases an object at the temperature of the filament in an incandescent light bulb—roughly 3000 k , or 10 times room temperature—radiates 10,000 times as much energy per unit area this principle applies to all properties of the wave , including wavelength ( color ) , direction , polarization , and even coherence , so that it is quite possible to have thermal radiation which is polarized , coherent , and directional , though polarized and coherent forms are fairly rare in nature far from sources ( in terms of wavelength ) see section below for more on this qualification for example , although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent , near-field thermal radiation ( i.e where \epsilon_1 and \epsilon_2 are the emissivities of the surfaces incandescence infrared photography interior radiation control coating heat transfer planck radiation radiant cooling sakuma–hattori equation thermal dose unit view factor
