magnesium oxide is produced by the calcination of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide high temperatures 1500 – 2000 & nbsp ; °c diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned ( often called dead burnt ) magnesia , an unreactive form used as a refractory it is a principal fireproofing ingredient in construction materials mgo is widely regarded as the most effective metals stabilization compound when compared to portland cement , lime , kiln dust products , power generation waste products , and various proprietary products due to mgo 's superior buffering capacity , cost effectiveness , and ease/safety of handling most , if not all products that are marketed as metals stabilization technologies create very high ph conditions in aquifers whereas mgo creates an ideal aquifer condition with a ph of 8–10 it has an e number of e530 the extensive use is due to its high dielectric strength and average thermal conductivity mgo is usually crushed and compacted with minimal airgaps or voids the electrical heating industry also experimented with aluminium oxide , but it is not used anymore the refractive index is 1.72 at 1 & nbsp ; µm and the abbe number is 53.58 magnesium oxide for the animal feed industry magnesium oxide is used as an oxide barrier in spin-tunneling devices 600 & nbsp ; k for al 2 o 3
