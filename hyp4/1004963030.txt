military and political requirements for some time this deterrent force had been based on the royal air force 's v bomber force having already put some effort into the skybolt warhead , it was decided to adapt this design , based on the thermonuclear secondary of the us w59 , matched to a primary trigger based on a wholly uk design developed from the cleo device tested at the pampas ugt instead of the w58 used on us navy missiles in the end the us abandoned antelope because they could achieve the same ends simply by throwing additional warheads , which was becoming increasingly inexpensive with the introduction of mirvs with mirv , a single missile could launch multiple warheads that separated in space , forcing the defender to use multiple abms to attack them a single new ballistic missile would demand multiple abms to counter it , this cost-exchange ratio ultimately convincing the us that abms were infeasible by this point the us and ussr had agreed in the abm treaty to deploy up to 100 abms at only two sites they also explored a '' superhardened '' version known as super antelope , a further improvement on the warhead that also used a manoeuvrable warhead '' bus '' to deploy the penaids further apart in space this option also had the advantage of maintaining commonality with the us navy , as well as offering greater range , and thus increasing the safety of the launch submarines although in theory the uk might be able to use the us-designed bus , these options were being explored in the midst of the abm treaty , and it was not clear whether the treaty might forbid this technology being transferred in the end the higher levels of the british political system decided against the urgings of their own chiefs of staff and went with the penaid approach on the existing a3t missile the name 'chevaline ' was the result of a telephone call to london zoo from an official at the ministry of defence prompted by a request for a name-change from his boss , the secretary of state for defence , lord carrington , the official asked the zoo to 'imagine an animal like a large antelope ' and inquired whether there was such a beast peter hennessy , cabinets and the bomb p.278 if the polaris fleet was forced to operate to the north of the line , or even within a limited distance of it , they would be lacking the protection of the bulk of the nato forces , and potentially in the midst of a high concentration of enemy hunter-killer subs the project was finally revealed by margaret thatcher 's then defence minister francis pym the reasons for revelation were both political and practical the naval staff angst that had been a feature of the chevaline project surfaced here too re-entry body ( reb ) 3dqp is a phenolic-based material composed of a quartz cloth material woven into a seamless sock shape cloth impregnated with a phenolic resin and hot-pressed the quartz material 'hardens ' the reb protecting the nuclear warhead against high-energy neutrons emitted by exo-atmospheric anti-ballistic missile ( abm ) bursts before re-entry public record office , london the national archives , london nuclear weapons and the united kingdom polaris chevaline ( now dated obsolete inaccurate source ) prospero / journal of the british rocket oral history project , 2004 the unveiling of chevaline polaris improvements and the chevaline programme dr peter jones , director , awe ( ret ) numerous authors and papers published as proceedings of a royal aeronautical society symposium held oct 2004
