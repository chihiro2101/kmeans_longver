reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to '' fade away '' in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped when it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter , the term t 60 ( an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 & nbsp ; db ) is used t 60 provides an objective reverberation time measurement rooms used for speech typically need a shorter reverberation time so that speech can be understood more clearly the two signals can be compared mathematically using a two-port system allows reverberation time to be measured with signals other than loud impulses the concept of reverberation time implicitly supposes that the decay rate of the sound is exponential , so that the sound level diminishes regularly , at a rate of so many db per second in 1965 , manfred r this would have an absorption coefficient of 1 several composers employ the reverberation effect as a main sound resource , having a comparable relevance as the solo instrument for example , pauline oliveros , henrique machado machado , henrique a performer or a producer of live or recorded music often induces reverberation in a work early units had one pickup for mono output , and later models featured two pickups for stereo use the emt 140 weighs 400 pounds ( 180 & nbsp ; kg ) , 600 pounds ( 270 & nbsp ; kg ) in manufacturers shipping crate patent 2,230,836 , granted feb the hammond organ included a built-in spring reverberator since reverberation is essentially caused by a very large number of echoes , simple reverberation algorithms use several feedback delay circuits to create a large , decaying series of echoes more advanced digital reverb generators can simulate the time and frequency domain response of a specific room ( using room dimensions , absorption , and other properties ) '' reverberation , or informally , '' reverb '' or '' verb '' , is one of the most universally used effects unit and is often found in guitar pedals , synthesizers , effects units , digital audio workstations ( daws ) and vst plug-ins
