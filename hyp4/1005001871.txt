a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit two-phase clock because the two phases are guaranteed non-overlapping , gated latches rather than edge-triggered flip-flops can be used to store state information so long as the inputs to latches on one phase only depend on outputs from latches on the other phase these were generated externally for both the 6800 and 8080 microprocessors later intel produced the 8224 clock generator and motorola produced the mc6875 the intel 8085 and the motorola 6802 include this circuitry on the microprocessor chip the 8080 requires more clock cycles to execute a processor instruction this was particularly common among early microprocessors such as the national semiconductor imp-16 , texas instruments tms9900 , and the western digital wd16 chipset used in the dec lsi-11 jouppi and jeffrey y this allows the cpu to operate at a much higher frequency than the rest of the computer , which affords performance gains in situations where the cpu does not need to wait on an external factor ( like memory or input/output ) in reversible computing , inductors can be used to store this energy and reduce the energy loss , but they tend to be quite large alternatively , using a sine wave clock , cmos transmission gates and energy-saving techniques , the power requirements can be reduced since this function is vital to the operation of a synchronous system , much attention has been given to the characteristics of these clock signals and the electrical networks used in their distribution the proper design of the clock distribution network helps ensure that critical timing requirements are satisfied and that no race conditions exist ( see also clock skew )
