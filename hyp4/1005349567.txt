a few years later , near pawlett were recovered by means of embankments ; and three further reclamations , totalling , had been undertaken downstream of bridgwater by 1660 however , the work was delayed by the english civil war and later defeated in parliament after local opposition it is unclear why windmills were not employed , as they were on the fens of east anglia , but only two examples have been recorded on the levels : one at bleadon at the mouth of the river axe , where a sea wall had been built , and the other at common moor north of glastonbury , which was being drained following a private act of parliament in 1721 the first steam pumping station was westonzoyland pumping station in 1830 , followed by more effective ones from 1860 automatic electric pumps are used today geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible : thus , water is pumped up into the river throughout the year the levels were frequently flooded by the sea during high tides , a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20th & nbsp ; century on 13 december 1981 , a december 1981 windstorm as part of the published flood risk assessments for both these sub-areas , it is recognised that : at a future date a tidal clyse may be needed on the parrett ; this causes a funding dilemma ; and , geomorphology studies of the parrett and the tone are needed to help address many of the uncertainties associated with a tidal exclusion project in 1872 , another flood covered and in 1919 , were inundated with sea water , poisoning the land for up to 7 & nbsp ; years subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man 's using the levels only in the summer , hence the county of somerset may derive its name from sumorsaete , meaning land of the summer people the track was built between what was in the early 4th & nbsp ; millennium bc an island at westhay and a ridge of high ground at shapwick , close to the river brue clay was later spread over the peat , providing raised stands for occupation , industry and movement , and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone the discovery at shapwick of 9,238 & nbsp ; silver roman coins , the shapwick hoard ever found from the roman empire included coins dated from as early as 31–30 bc up until 224 ad after the battle of ethandun the danish king was baptised at aller and a peace treaty signed at wedmore the levels have few wooded areas , just occasional willow trees from january until may , the river parrett provides a source of european eels ( anguilla anguilla ) and young elvers , which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them other local industries that once thrived on the levels , such as thatching ( using reeds ) and basket making ( using willow ) , have been in decline since the second half of the 20th century the site is one of eight announced by the british government in 2010 , and in november 2012 a nuclear site licence was granted in march 2017 , edf , after the office for nuclear regulation gave approval to start building a network of tunnels to carry cabling and piping , started work also under way on a jetty , seawall and accommodation blocks the somerset levels is now the only area in the uk where basket willow is grown commercially historically willow was used to make salmon traps or '' putchers '' at stoke st gregory there is also a willows and wetlands visitor centre the area is an important feeding ground for birds including tundra swan , eurasian curlew , common redshank , eurasian skylark , common snipe , eurasian teal , wigeon , and eurasian whimbrel , as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon a wide range of insect species is also present , including rare invertebrates , particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle , bagous nodulosus , hydrophilus piceus , odontomyia angulata , oulema erichsoni , and valvata macrostoma the '' great crane project '' aims to introduce around 20 of the birds each year until 2015 it aims to ensure that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably about of the levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area , and other areas are designated as area of archaeological potential , but there is currently no single conservation designation covering the levels and moors this project , based on the village of shapwick , was begun by mick aston of bristol university to investigate the evolution of a typical english village a report on the project , which ran from 1989 to 1999 , was published in eight volumes landranger map 183 : yeovil & frome published in 2005 by the ordnance survey visitors ' centres aim to convey various aspects of the levels the site offers much information on iron age finds , round houses , and ancient highways , the post track and sweet track in february 2009 somerset county council , the owner of the peat moors centre , announced its intention of closing the centre and it finally shut on 31 october 2009 , but it was reopened as the avalon marshes centre and is in the process of being modernized and improved from the previous set of buildings other exhibits show local crafts , including willow coppicing , mud horse fishing on the flats of bridgwater bay , peat digging on the somerset levels and the production of milk , cheese , and cider
