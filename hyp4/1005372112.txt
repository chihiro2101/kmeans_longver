these requirements have led to successful use of the fireteam concept by more professional militaries conscription makes fireteam development difficult , as team members are more effective as they build experience over time working together and building personal bonds two fireteams form an 'assault group ' which is analogous to most other militaries ' understanding of a fireteam ; two assault groups and a vehicle group of one driver and one gunner form a section of ten soldiers under earlier fireteam organisation there also were two riflemen , but the second of these was later substituted for a designated marksman , leaving the section with one rifleman per fireteam gunner : one private per section carries an l7a2 gpmg headquarters , department of the army : attp 3-06.11 ( fm 3-06.11 ) – combined arms operations in urban terrain ( june 2011 ) headquarters , department of the army : fm 3-21.8 – the infantry rifle platoon and squad ( march 2007 ) team leader ( tl ) : usually either a sergeant or corporal ( although occasionally a team is led by a specialist or private first class when the platoon has a shortage of junior ncos ) they are equipped with the m16 rifle or m4 carbine a grenadier is equipped with an m4/m16 with the m203 grenade launcher ( or newer m320 grenade launcher ) mounted to the weapon '' designated automatic rifleman : uses the m249 light machine gun or m27 iar and serves as second in command for the fireteam ; '' fire '' assistant automatic rifleman : standard rifleman tasked with providing spotting support , range-finding , carries extra lmg-ammunition , and offering close-protection should the fireteam fall under attack ; '' assist navy construction force , '' seabee '' construction battalions , utilise fireteams ( as well as companies , platoons , and squads ) , similar in size to those employed by the usmc , in their organisational structure in order to combat this stalemate , the germans developed a doctrinal innovation known as infiltration tactics ( based on the russian tactics used in the brusilov offensive ) , in which a brief intensive artillery preparation would be followed by small , autonomous teams of stormtroopers , who would covertly penetrate defensive lines french chasseur units in wwi were organised into fireteams , equipped with a light machine gun ( chauchat ) team and grenades , to destroy german fire positions by fire ( not assault ) at up to 200 meters using rifle grenades the chasseur tactics were proven during the petain offensive of 1917 mihiel and the argonne carlson and merritt a at that time the us marine squad consisted of a corporal and seven marines all armed with a bolt-action m1903 springfield rifle and an automatic rifleman armed with a browning automatic rifle carlson later brought these ideas back to the us when the country entered world war ii a firegroup was composed of an m1 garand rifleman , a bar gunner and a submachine gunner 56 & 73 retrieved 2 november 2016 divided into three teams : the a '' able '' ( contemporary spelling alphabet ) team consisted of the squad leader and two scouts , the support b '' baker '' team with the bar gunner , assistant gunner , and ammunition bearer , and c '' charlie '' team ( assistant squad leader , also serving as the anti-tank grenadier , and five riflemen , one of whom served as the alternate anti-tank grenadier ) a battle pair is the smallest unit above the individual soldier , in the modern era chiefly employed by baltic militaries and special forces like the special air service the french army has the concept of a binôme ‘ pair ’
