born in the hague , netherlands , he was one of five children of dirk cornelis tinbergen and his wife jeannette van eek they are the only siblings to each win a nobel prize several of his graduate students went on to become prominent biologists including richard dawkins , marian dawkins , desmond morris , iain douglas-hamilton , and tony sinclair in this case , the chemical stimuli of the odour allowed the next link in the chain to be released , encouraging the bee to land in his nobel lecture , tinbergen addressed the somewhat unconventional decision of the nobel foundation to award the prize for physiology or medicine to three men who had until recently been regarded as '' mere animal watchers '' acta paediatrica 96 , 1105â€“1108 ( 2007 ) the work of tinbergen during this time was also regarded as having possible implications for further research in child development and behaviour . other awards and honours he was elected a fellow of the royal society ( frs ) in 1962 which were : causality ( mechanism ) : what are the stimuli that elicit the response , and how has it been modified by recent learning ? how do behaviour and psyche '' function '' on the molecular , physiological , neuro-ethological , cognitive and social level , and what do the relations between the levels look like ? ( compare : nicolai hartmann : '' the laws about the levels of complexity '' ) development ( ontogeny ) : how does the behaviour change with age , and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown ? which developmental steps ( the ontogenesis follows an '' inner plan '' ) and which environmental factors play when / which role ? ( compare : recapitulation theory ) function ( adaptation ) : how does the behaviour impact on the animal 's chances of survival and reproduction ? evolution ( phylogeny ) : how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species , and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny ? why did structural associations ( behaviour can be seen as a '' time space structure '' ) evolve in this manner and not otherwise ? in ethology and sociobiology , causation and ontogeny are summarised as the '' proximate mechanisms '' , while adaptation and phylogeny are the '' ultimate mechanisms '' tinbergen found that territorial male three-spined stickleback ( a small freshwater fish ) would attack a wooden fish model more vigorously than a real male if its underside was redder among the modern works calling attention to tinbergen 's classic work is deirdre barrett 's 2010 book , supernormal stimuli 1951 : the study of instinct ( print ) ; ( ebook ) publications about tinbergen and his work : burkhardt jr oxford , oxford university press stamp dawkins , m ; halliday , tr ; dawkins , r ( 1991 )
