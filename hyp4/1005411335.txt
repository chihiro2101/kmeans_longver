a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight their first transistors were of the silicon mesa variety , innovative for their time , but relatively poor reliability more were sold to autonetics to build the guidance system for the minuteman ballistic missile at the same time jean hoerni developed the planar process which was a huge improvement & nbsp ; – transistors could be made more easily , at a lower cost and with higher performance and reliability in 1960 , fairchild built a circuit with four transistors on a single wafer of silicon , thereby creating the first silicon integrated circuit ( texas instruments ' jack kilby had developed an integrated circuit made of germanium on september 12 , 1958 , and was awarded a u.s in turn , hoerni 's planar process was inspired by the surface passivation method developed by mohamed atalla at bell labs in 1957 in the early 1960s , fairchild r & d began experimenting with the mosfet ( metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ) , also known as the mos transistor mos devices were later commercialized by fairchild in 1964 , with p-channel devices for logic and switching applications while the fairchild corporation claims the diné women were chosen to work in the shiprock plant due to their '' 'nimble fingers ' '' as previously noted , the women of the shiprock reservation were actually chosen as the workforce due to a lack of labor rights asserted by the women in addition to '' cheap , plentiful workers and tax benefits '' it was awhile before fairchild relied on more robust designs , such as diode–transistor logic ( dtl ) which had much better noise margins in 1966 , fairchild 's sales were second to those of texas instruments , followed in third place by motorola carter responded to the order by resigning abruptly within a few months hodgson was replaced by a management committee led by noyce , while sherman fairchild looked for a new ceo other than noyce vadász , who took with them the revolutionary silicon gate ( sgt ) , recently created in the fairchild r & d laboratory by federico faggin who also designed the fairchild 3708 , the world ’ s first commercial mos integrated circuit using sgt hogan proceeded to hire another hundred managers from motorola to entirely displace the management of fairchild see also gregory gromov a legal bridge spanning 100 years : from the gold mines of el dorado to the '' golden '' startups of silicon valley by gregory gromov and techcrunch 2014 update of hoefler 's article the ccd had a difficult birth , with the devastating effects on fairchild of the 1973–75 recession that followed on the 1973 oil crisis '' in 1976 , the company released the first video game system to use rom cartridges , the fairchild video entertainment system ( or ves ) later renamed channel f , using the f8 microprocessor fairchild was being operated at a loss , and the bottomline subsisted mostly from licensing of its patents the sale did not include fairchild 's test division , which designed and produced automated test equipment ( ate ) for the semiconductor manufacturing industry , nor did it include schlumberger palo alto research on march 11 , 1997 , national semiconductor corporation announced the us 550 million sale of a reconstituted fairchild to the management of fairchild with the backing of sterling llc , a unit of citicorp venture capital the acquisition was completed on december 31 , 1997 the deal was finalized in april 1999 for 450 million fairchild 's south portland , maine and mountaintop , pennsylvania locations are the longest continuously operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world , both operating since 1960 the acquisition moved fairchild into position as the second-largest power mosfet supplier in the world , representing a 20 percent share of this 3 billion market that grew 40 percent last year thompson would also be president , chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors of fairchild semiconductor international pond would continue as a member of the company ’ s board of directors ) to sunnyvale ( 1272 borregas ave lyon gordon moore robert noyce stav prodromou chih-tang sah jerry sanders ed turney leslie l
