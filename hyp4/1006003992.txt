because the different radial directions around the aircraft 's direction of travel are equivalent ( given the '' smooth flight '' condition ) , the shock wave forms a mach cone , similar to a vapour cone , with the aircraft at its tip this eventually doomed most sst projects as public resentment , mixed with politics , eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft less useful ( flying supersonically only over water for instance ) small aeroplane designs like business jets are favoured and tend to produce minimal to no audible booms seebass and george also worked on the problem from a different angle , trying to spread out the n-wave laterally and temporally ( longitudinally ) , by producing a strong and downwards-focused ( sr-71 blackbird , boeing x-43 ) shock at a sharp , but wide angle nose cone , which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ( bow shock ) , and using a swept back flying wing or an oblique wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight ( the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed ) ssbd used an f-5 freedom fighter over 50 test flights were performed there are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all , such as the busemann biplane nasa and lockheed martin aeronautics co . perception , noise and other concerns it is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition ; rather , the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight '' bbc news interview with former concorde pilot ( 2003 ) even strong n-waves such as those generated by concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long the energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1â€“100 & nbsp ; hertz frequency range that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft , gunshot and most industrial noise the speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature a decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed temperature variations , humidity , atmospheric pollution , and winds can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom a bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker
