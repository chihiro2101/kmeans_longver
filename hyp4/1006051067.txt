cofactors for enhanced enzymatic activity lipoylation ( a type of acylation ) , attachment of a lipoate ( c 8 ) functional group flavin moiety ( fmn or fad ) may be covalently attached heme c attachment via thioether bonds with cysteines phosphopantetheinylation , the addition of a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety from coenzyme a , as in fatty acid , polyketide , non-ribosomal peptide and leucine biosynthesis retinylidene schiff base formation amide bond formation amino acid addition arginylation , a trna-mediation addition polyglutamylation , covalent linkage of glutamic acid residues to the n-terminus of tubulin and some other proteins other proteins or peptides sumoylation : molecular biology and biochemistry neddylation , the covalent linkage to nedd pupylation , the covalent linkage to the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein ptm information can be collected through experimental means or predicted from high-quality , manually curated data numerous databases have been created , often with a focus on certain taxonomic groups ( e.g dbptm â€“ a database that shows different ptm 's and information regarding their chemical components/structures and a frequency for amino acid modified site uniprot has ptm information although that may be less comprehensive than in more specialized databases post-translational modifications consisting of epigenetic alterations of histone protein tails in specific regions of the brain appear to be crucial to the molecular basis of addictions cigarette smokers ( about 21 % of the us population in 2013 ) substance abuse and mental health services administration , results from the 2013 national survey on drug use and health : summary of national findings , nsduh series h-48 , hhs publication no after 7 days of nicotine treatment of mice , the post-translational modifications consisting of acetylation of both histone h3 and histone h4 was increased at the fosb promoter in the nucleus accumbens of the brain , causing a 61 % increase in fosb expression this caused increased dopamine release in the pfc reward system brain region , and such increased dopamine release is recognized as an important factor for addiction about 7 % of the us population is addicted to alcohol this acetylation is an activating mark for pronociceptin
