the first 20 minutes wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) or dark matter and dark energy may have appeared and been the catalyst for the expansion of the singularity gravity separates and begins operating on the universe—the remaining fundamental forces stabilize into the electronuclear force , also known as the grand unified force or grand unified theory ( gut ) , mediated by ( the hypothetical ) x and y bosons which allow early matter at this stage to fluctuate between baryon and lepton states a wide array of exotic elementary particles result from decay of x and y bosons which include w and z bosons and higgs bosons the universe is supercooled from about 10 27 down to 10 22 kelvin ) , the very early universe ( 1985 ) the temperature is still too high for quarks to coalesce into hadrons , and the quark–gluon plasma persists ( quark epoch ) 10 −6 seconds : hadron epoch begins : as the universe cools to about 10 10 kelvin , a quark-hadron transition takes place in which quarks bind to form more complex particles—hadrons at this temperature , the hadrons and antihadrons annihilate each other , leaving behind leptons and antileptons – possible disappearance of antiquarks gravity governs the expansion of the universe : neutrinos decouple from matter creating a cosmic neutrino background 3 minutes : primordial nucleosynthesis : nuclear fusion begins as lithium and heavy hydrogen ( deuterium ) and helium nuclei form from protons and neutrons 370,000 years ( z 1,100 ) : the '' dark ages '' is the period between decoupling , when the universe first becomes transparent , until the formation of the first stars the temperature falls to 3000 kelvin ordinary matter particles decouple from radiation 400,000 years : density waves begin imprinting characteristic polarization ( waves ) signals because it is a population ii star , some suggestions have been raised that second generation star formation may have begun very early on 700 million years : galaxies form gn-108036 forms—galaxy is 5 times larger and 100 times more massive than the present day milky way illustrating the size attained by some galaxies very early on formation of sdss j102915+172927 : unusual population ii star that is extremely metal poor consisting of mainly hydrogen and helium lae j095950.99+021219.1 , one of the most remote lyman alpha emitter galaxies , forms 890 million years : galaxy sxdf-nb1006-2 forms 900 million years : galaxy bdf-3299 forms reionization complete—the universe becomes transparent again galaxies may have begun clustering creating the largest structures in the universe so far -
