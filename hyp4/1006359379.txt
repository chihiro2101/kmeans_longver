definitions of the term '' machine vision '' vary , but all include the technology and methods used to extract information from an image on an automated basis , as opposed to image processing , where the output is another image the primary uses for machine vision are automatic inspection and industrial robot/process guidance ; in this section the former is abbreviated as '' automatic inspection '' methods and sequence of operation while conventional ( 2d visible light ) imaging is most commonly used in mv , alternatives include multispectral image , hyperspectral imaging , imaging various infrared bands , line scan imaging , 3d imaging of surfaces and x-ray imaging lines from multiple scans are assembled into a depth map or point cloud 3-d imaging : a practical overview for machine vision by fred turek & kim jackson quality magazine , march 2014 issue , volume 53/number 3 pages 6-8 other 3d methods used for machine vision are time of flight and grid based one method is grid array based systems using pseudorandom structured light system as employed by the microsoft kinect system circa 2012 a typical sequence might start with tools such as filters which modify the image , followed by extraction of objects , then extraction ( e.g the value is then used to separate portions of the image , and sometimes to transform each portion of the image to simply black and white based on whether it is below or above that grayscale value pixel counting : counts the number of light or dark pixels segmentation : partitioning a digital image into multiple segments to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze linda shapiro and george c barcode , data matrix and '' 2d barcode '' reading optical character recognition : automated reading of text such as serial numbers metrology : measurement of object dimensions ( e.g for verification of alpha-numberic codes , the ocr 'd value is compared to the proper or target value many of the process steps are the same as with automatic inspection except with a focus on providing position and orientation information as the end result
