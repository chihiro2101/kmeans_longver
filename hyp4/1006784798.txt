electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow still larger electrodes , such as uninsulated needles and surface electrodes used by clinical and surgical neurophysiologists , are sensitive only to certain types of synchronous activity within populations of cells numbering in the millions however , the word electrography has other senses ( including electrophotography ) , and the specific types of electrophysiological recording are usually called by specific names , constructed on the pattern of electro- + body part combining form + -graphy ( abbreviation exg ) a disadvantage ( compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes ) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode , and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted also the patch of membrane can be pulled away from the rest of the cell in situations where one wants to record the potential inside the cell membrane with minimal effect on the ionic constitution of the intracellular fluid a sharp electrode can be used these micropipettes ( electrodes ) are again like those for patch clamp pulled from glass capillaries , but the pore is much smaller so that there is very little ion exchange between the intracellular fluid and the electrolyte in the pipette hubel and wiesel were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1981 this type of recording is often called '' multi-unit recording '' , and is often used in conscious animals to record changes in the activity in a discrete brain area during normal activity many monoamine neurotransmitters ; e.g , norepinephrine ( noradrenalin ) , dopamine , and serotonin ( 5-ht ) are oxidizable file : planar patch chip.jpg scanning electron microscope image of a planar patch clamp chip both the pipette and the chip are made from borosilicate glass it is important to note that mechanical perturbations , which usually destroy a biological lipid membrane , do not influence the life-time of an ssm . bioelectric recognition assay ( bera ) ( 2009 ) development of a novel , ultra-rapid biosensor for the qualitative detection of hepatitis b virus-associated antigens and anti-hbv , based on '' membrane-engineered '' fibroblast cells with virus-specific antibodies and antigens sensors 9 : 2176–86 veterinary disease agents ( foot and mouth disease virus , prions , and blue tongue virus ) , and plant viruses ( tobacco and cucumber viruses ) moschopoulou g food control 29 : 208–12 in food , and 2,4,6-trichloroanisole in cork and wine , varelas , v talanta 84 : 936–40 apostolou t , pascual n , marco m-p , moschos a , petropoulos a , kaltsas g , kintzios s ( 2014 ) extraction-less , rapid assay for the direct detection of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole ( tca ) in cork samples talanta 125 : 336–40 ( 2012 ) superoxide determination using membrane-engineered cells : an example of a novel concept for the construction of cell sensors with customized target recognition properties actuat.175 : 88–94 a bera sensor has two parts : the consumable biorecognition elements the electronic read-out device with embedded artificial intelligence ( 2013 ) pesticide residue screening using a novel artificial neural network combined with a bioelectric cellular biosensor kokla a , blouchos p journal of molecular recognition 26 : 627–232 the benefit of such methods is the high level of detail of the active conduction mechanism , given by the inherently high resolution and data density that atomistic simulation affords clinical electrophysiology is the study of how electrophysiological principles and technologies can be applied to human health for example , clinical cardiac electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties which govern heart rhythm and activity scientists such as duchenne de boulogne ( 1806–1875 ) and nathaniel a the '' minimum information about a neuroscience investigation '' ( mini ) family of reporting guideline documents aims to provide a consistent set of guidelines in order to report an electrophysiology experiment
