in high production or high precision shops , a different set of problems were encountered where an experienced cnc machinist must both hand-code programs and run cam software usually it had been necessary to force the cad operator to export the data in one of the common data formats , such as iges or stl or parasolid formats that are supported by a wide variety of software the output from the cam software is usually a simple text file of g-code/m-codes , sometimes many thousands of commands long , that is then transferred to a machine tool using a direct numerical control ( dnc ) program or in modern controllers using a common usb storage device this is occurring primarily in three arenas : ease of usage manufacturing complexity integration with plm and the extended enterprise ; ease in use : for the user who is just getting started as a cam user , out-of-the-box capabilities providing process wizards , templates , libraries , machine tool kits , automated feature based machining and job function specific tailorable user interfaces build user confidence and speed the learning curve ; manufacturing complexity : the manufacturing environment is increasingly complex the need for cam and plm tools by the manufacturing engineer , nc programmer or machinist is similar to the need for computer assistance by the pilot of modern aircraft systems : today 's cam systems support the full range of machine tools including : turning , 5 axis machining , waterjet , laser / plasma cutting , and wire edm today â€™ s cam user can easily generate streamlined tool paths , optimized tool axis tilt for higher feed rates , better tool life and surface finish , and ideal cutting depth in milling , the result often gives the appearance of terraces or steps , because the strategy has taken multiple '' steps '' down the part as it removes material when finishing a part , the steps between passes is minimal to prevent tool deflection and material spring back in addition to modifying speeds and feeds , machinists will often have finishing specific endmills , which never used as roughing endmills . software : large vendors .
