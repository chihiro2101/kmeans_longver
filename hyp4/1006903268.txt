the small coastal sailing ships of the day were often damaged by atlantic storms , and risked being attacked by warships of the french navy and privateers during a succession of conflicts with france work commenced in 1718 , under the supervision of surveyor and engineer john hore of newbury the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure in 1801 , trade along the canal commenced ; goods initially had to be unloaded at foxhangers at the bottom of what is now caen hill locks , transported up the hill by a wagonway , and reloaded into barges at the top when the flight of locks opened in 1810 , allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal , the rate of carriage per ton from london to bath was £2 & nbsp ; 9s & nbsp ; 6d in 1812 , the kennet and avon canal company bought the kennet navigation , which stretched from newbury to the junction with the thames at kennet mouth , near reading the purchase from frederick page cost £100,000 , of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually the journey from bath to newbury took an average of three and a half days by 1832 , 300,000 & nbsp ; tons of freight was being carried each year and , between 1825 and 1834 , the company had an annual revenue of around £45,000 by 1868 the annual tonnage had fallen from 360,610 in 1848 to 210,567 in 1926 , following a loss of £18,041 the previous year , the great western railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a ministry of transport order , but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal cargo trade continued to decline , but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal they were generally built close to road and rail bridges , which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles in july 1958 , the bowes committee published their inquiry into inland waterways which specifically mentioned the kennet and avon finding '' no justification for restoring the section from reading to bath '' a government white paper followed the bowes report in february 1959 , recommending that an inland waterways redevelopment advisory committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that were no longer able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep the kennet and avon canal trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from reading to bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity in 1963 the newly formed british waterways , which was created by the transport act of the previous year , and replaced the british transport commission as the statutory body for inland waterways , took over the canal and , in partnership with the trust and riparian local authorities , restoration work began the canal was reopened from the thames to hungerford wharf in july 1974 frounds swing bridge could not be opened and the restoration of midgham lock had not been finished ; both were completed the following year the pumps raise water at a rate of per hour ( 380 & nbsp ; litres per second ) the work funded included complete rebuilding of foxhangers lock and bridge at caen hill , replacement of lock gates at seend and crofton , channel lining at claverton , embankment repairs at martinslade , improvements at claverton pumping station and dredging at various sites between 2002 and 2004 the dundas aqueduct , which had been relined with polythene and concrete in 1984 without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct , was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the great western railway with bath stone to match the original work the stretch from bristol to bath is made navigable by the use of locks and weirs at hanham , keynsham , swineford , saltford , kelston and weston , which together overcome a rise of within some spring tides pass over the weir at hanham , making the river tidal up to keynsham lock on the northern bank is cleeve wood , the primary scientific importance of which lies in its particularly large population of bath asparagus ( ornithogalum pyrenaicum ) the river passes under the old railway line that now forms the avon valley railway , a heritage railway , before reaching swineford lock above the top lock the canal passes through sydney gardens via two short tunnels and under two cast iron footbridges dating from 1800 a trap-door in the tunnel roof was used to pass paperwork between clerks above and bargees below sand martin and kingfisher have been seen regularly by the lake , and other migrants have included yellow wagtail , whinchat and hobby the building was completed in 1810 and the pump was working by 1813 after the avoncliff aqueduct the canal passes through barton farm country park , past gripwood quarry and a 14th-century grade ii listed tithe barn , long and wide , on its way into bradford on avon in 1977 the wilts & berks canal trust was formed with the aim of fully restoring the canal to re-connect the kennet and avon to the upper reaches of the thames the total rise is in or a 1 in 30 slope as a result , the 16 & nbsp ; locks utilise unusually large side ponds to store the water needed for their operation because a large volume of water is needed a back pump was installed at foxhangers in 1996 , capable of returning of water per day to the top of the flight , equivalent to one lockful every 11 & nbsp ; minutes while the locks were under construction in the early 19th century a tramroad provided a link between foxhangers at the bottom of the flight and devizes at the top , the remains of which can be seen in the towpath arches in the road bridges over the canal at honeystreet is the remains of a wharf that was the home of boat builders robbins , lane and pinnegar , which served as the boat building headquarters of the canal company water is pumped to the summit at the western end of the locks , from wilton water , by the restored crofton pumping station hungerford marsh lock is unique on the kennet and avon canal in that it has a swing bridge directly over the centre of the lock that must be opened before the lock may be used the canal passes through an area known as the kennet valley alderwoods , the largest remaining fragments of damp , ash-alder woodland in the river kennet floodplain in addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes radula complanata , zygodon viridissimus and orthotrichum affine nearby is irish hill copse this site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides , merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen , on the higher parts of the site it is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations , which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler ( acrocephalus scirpaceus ) , a species that in britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat this narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as county lock the canal today is a heritage tourism destination the annual devizes to westminster international canoe marathon starts from devizes wharf , the site of the kennet & avon canal museum , at first light on good friday each year and the competitors have to negotiate 75 & nbsp ; locks in the route between devizes and the finish at westminster there are a variety of riverside pub , shops and tea rooms the canal and its environs are important for wildlife conservation there are several site of special scientific interest ( sssi ) , which exhibit great biodiversity there are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal wilton water by crofton locks and the kennet valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl phragmites ( phragmites australis ) is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal
