prussian blue pigment is significant since it was the first stable and relatively lightfast blue pigment to be widely used following the loss of knowledge regarding the synthesis of egyptian blue prussian blue ( also · x was probably synthesized for the first time by the paint maker diesbach in berlin around 1706 most historical sources do not mention a first name of diesbach it was named and in 1709 by its first trader ) , berlin , stankiewicz buchdruck , reprint hildesheim/new york : georg olms verlag , 1976 the pigment replaced the expensive lapis lazuli and was an important topic in the letters exchanged between johann leonhard frisch and the president of the prussian academy of sciences , gottfried wilhelm leibniz , between 1708 and 1716 frisch himself is the author of the first known publication of prussian blue in the paper in 1710 , as can be deduced from his letters diesbach had been working for frisch since about 1701 macquer , pierre-joseph ( 1752 ) '' éxamen chymique de bleu de prusse , '' mémoires de l'académie royale des sciences année 1752 ( 1752 ) , ( paris , 1756 ) , pp reprinted in latin as : '' de materia tingente caerulei berolinensis '' in : carl wilhelm scheele with ernst benjamin gottlieb hebenstreit ( ed ) and gottfried heinrich schäfer ( trans a '' soluble '' form , , which is really colloidal , can be made from potassium ferrocyanide and iron ( iii ) : : + + → the similar reaction of potassium ferricyanide and iron ( ii ) results in the same colloidal solution , because is converted into ferrocyanide its precise identification was complicated by three factors : prussian blue is extremely insoluble , but also tends to form colloids traditional syntheses tend to afford impure compositions even pure prussian blue is structurally complex , defying routine crystallographic analysis the structure was determined by using ir spectroscopy , mössbauer spectroscopy , x-ray crystallography , and neutron crystallography since x-ray diffraction can not easily distinguish carbon from nitrogen in the presence of heavier elements such as iron , the location of these lighter elements is deduced by spectroscopic means , as well as by observing the distances from the iron atom centers in ideal insoluble pb crystals , the cubic framework is built from fe ( ii ) –c–n–fe ( iii ) sequences , with fe ( ii ) –carbon distances of 1.92 å and fe ( iii ) –nitrogen distances of 2.03 å in artists ' pigments washington , dc : national gallery of art the dominant uses are for pigments : about 12,000 tonnes of prussian blue are produced annually for use in black and bluish inks similarly , prussian blue is the basis for laundry bluing in particular , it was used to absorb from those poisoned in the goiânia accident the original stain formula , known historically ( 1867 ) as '' perls prussian blue '' after its inventor , german pathologist max perls ( 1843–1881 ) , used separate solutions of potassium ferrocyanide and acid to stain tissue ( these are now used combined , just before staining ) . by machinists and toolmakers prussian blue is formed in the prussian blue assay for total phenols samples and phenolic standards are given acidic ferric chloride and ferricyanide , which is reduced to ferrocyanide by the phenols
