the reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction carey , part a regardless of which situation pertains , the homo and lumo of the components are in phase and a bonding interaction results as can be seen in the diagram below the '' prevailing opinion '' carey , part a despite the fact that the vast majority of diels–alder reactions exhibit stereospecific , syn addition of the two components , a diradical intermediate has been postulated ( and supported with computational evidence ) on the grounds that the observed stereospecificity does not rule out a two-step addition involving an intermediate that collapses to product faster than it can rotate to allow for inversion of stereochemistry and even in water ) on those same carbons with respect to the cyclohexene ring likewise , cis , cis- and trans , trans-disubstitued dienes give cis substituents at these carbons of the product whereas cis , trans-disubstituted dienes give trans substituents : diels–alder reactions in which adjacent stereocenters are generated at the two ends of the newly-formed single bonds imply two different possible stereochemical outcomes in the context of the diels–alder reaction , the transition state in which the most significant substituent ( an electron-withdrawing and/or conjugating group ) on the dienophile is oriented towards the diene π system and slips under it as the reaction takes place is known as the endo transition state attractions may play a part as well , and solvent can sometimes make a substantial difference in selectivity on the contrary , stable dienes are rather unreactive and undergo diels–alder reactions only at elevated temperatures : for example , naphthalene can function as a diene , leading to adducts only with highly reactive dienophiles , such as n-phenyl-maleimide anthracene , being less aromatic ( and therefore more reactive for diels–alder syntheses ) in its central ring can form a 9,10 adduct with maleic anhydride at 80 & nbsp ; °c and even with acetylene , a weak dienophile , at 250 & nbsp ; °c editura academiei republicii socialiste românia this is a '' masked functionality '' which can be then hydrolyzed to form a ketone . variants on the classical diels–alder reaction carbonyl groups , for example , can successfully react with dienes to yield dihydropyran rings , a reaction known as the oxo-diels–alder reaction , and imines can be used , either as the dienophile or at various sites in the diene , to form various n-heterocyclic compounds through the aza-diels–alder reaction lewis acids such as zinc chloride , boron trifluoride , tin tetrachloride , aluminum chloride , etc can act as catalysts of normal-demand diels–alder reactions by coordination to the dienophile the diels–alder reaction is also employed in the production of vitamin b6 the work by diels and alder is described in a series of 28 articles published in the justus liebigs annalen der chemie and berichte der deutschen chemischen gesellschaft from 1928 to 1937 woodward 's syntheses of the steroids cortisone and cholesterol corey , in his original 1969 synthesis of prostaglandins f2α and e2 , utilized a diels–alder reaction early in the synthesis to establish the relative stereochemistry of three contiguous stereocenters on the prostaglandin cyclopentane core nicolaou 's group in the total synthesis of taxol the diene in this instance is notable as a rare example of a cyclic derivative of danishefsky 's diene conversion of the cis-aldehyde to its corresponding alkene by wittig olefination and subsequent ring-closing metathesis with a schrock carbene gave the second ring of the alkaloid core synthesized cantharadrin in 1980 by diels-alder , utilizing high pressure english translation of diels and alder 's seminal 1928 german article that won them the nobel prize
