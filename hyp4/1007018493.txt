as a result , these robotic missions required soft landers to sample the lunar soil and determine the thickness of the dust layer , which was unknown before surveyor the altair spacecraft , previously known as the '' lunar surface access module '' or '' lsam '' , was the planned lander for the constellation program prior to the cancellation of project constellation chang ' e 5 is currently scheduled for 2020 , while chang ' e 6 is planned for 2023 or 2024 venera 3 in 1966 and venera 7 in 1970 became the first impact and soft landing on venus respectively the soviet vega program also placed two balloons in the venusian atmosphere in 1985 , which were the first aerial tools on other planets the soviet union 's mars 1962b became the first earth-based mission intended to impact on mars in 1962 the soviet union planned the heavy marsokhod mars 4nm mission in 1973 and the mars sample return mars 5nm mission in 1975 , but neither occurred due to needing the n1 ( rocket ) that was never flown successfully viking 1 and viking 2 were launched respectively in august and september 1975 , each comprising an orbiter vehicle and a lander planned for 1996 , it failed at launch planned for 2018 , nasa 's mars astrobiology explorer-cacher lander mission was canceled due to budget cuts mmx will return to earth in 2029 russia plans to repeat its fobos-grunt mission around 2024 however , due to the low-speed impact , it continued providing data for more than two hours after it landed the first landing on a small solar system body ( an object in the solar system that is not a moon , planet , or dwarf planet ) was performed in 2001 by the probe near shoemaker at asteroid 433 eros despite the fact that near was not originally designed to be capable of landing the rosetta probe , launched 2 march 2004 , put the first robotic lander philae on the comet churyumov–gerasimenko on 12 november 2014 japan ( jaxa ) launched the hayabusa2 asteroid space probe in 2014 to deliver several landing parts ( including minerva ii and german mobile asteroid surface scout ( mascot ) landers and a small carry-on impactor ( sci ) penetrator ) in 2018–2019 to return samples to earth by 2020 the mse aspect of the mission was cancelled in 2003 due to budgetary constraints a few jupiter probes provide many images and other data about its moons the small nuclear-powered europa lander was proposed as part of nasa 's jupiter icy moons orbiter ( jimo ) mission that was canceled in 2006 the impact crater formed was approximately 200m wide and 30–50m deep , and scientists detected the presence of silicates , carbonates , smectite , amorphous carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons centaur impacted successfully on 9 october 2009 , at 11:31 utc the spacecraft 's impact with mercury occurred near 3:26pm edt on 30 april 2015 , leaving a crater estimated to be 16m in diameter
