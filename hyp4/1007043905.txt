in cases of nonobstructive ( secretory ) azoospermia , on the other hand , testicular sperm production is blocked at different stages of the process of sperm formation ( spermatogenesis ) moreover , the distinction between living round spermatids , to be used in rosi , and dead round spermatids , to be discarded , needs specific methods and skills , not required in the case of icsi where sperm cell viability can be easily evaluated on the basis of sperm motility in most cases the microinjection procedure for rosi also differs slightly from that of icsi , since additional stimuli are needed to ensure proper oocyte activation after spermatid injection fertil steril 2018 ; 110:443-451 comment by tesarik j , mendoza c , mendoza-tesarik r this procedure is most commonly used to overcome male infertility problems , although it may also be used where eggs can not easily be penetrated by sperm , and occasionally in addition to sperm donation the advantages in relation with other techniques revolve around sperm quality , as the selected ones have better motility , morphology , little dna fragmentation and less quantity of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) thanks to this fact , once the semen sample is passed through a column with a magnetic field , apoptotic respermatozoa are retained in the column while the healthy ones are easily obtained at the bottom of it immature spermatozoa do not bind to the acid , while mature do actually , the discovery was made by a mistake the first activated embryo by icsi was produced in 1990 , but the first successful birth by icsi took place on january 14 , 1992 after an april 1991 conception the sperm is then released into the oocyte however , in mid-2006 the fda cleared a device that allows embryologists to select mature sperm for icsi based on sperm binding to hyaluronan , the main constituent of the gel layer ( cumulus oophorus ) surrounding the oocyte the embryologist places the prepared sperm on the microdot , selects and captures sperm that bind to the dot worrilow , et al ultra-high magnification sperm injection ( imsi ) has no evidence of increased live birth or miscarriage rates compared to standard icsi , presentation '' new styles of icsi '' during eshre-workshop may 18 , 2019 gent/belgium '' top quality in micromanipulation : everything you always wanted to know about icsi and embryo biopsy '' the procedure includes specialized piezo actuators , microcapillaries , and filling medium to transfer mechanical pulses to the cell membranes assisted zona hatching ( ah ) preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) however , potential factors that may influence pregnancy rates ( and live birth rates ) in icsi include level of dna fragmentation as measured e.g in vanishing twin pregnancies with a second gestational sac with a dead fetus , first trimester screening should be based solely on the maternal age and the nuchal translucency scan as biomarkers are significantly altered in these cases .
