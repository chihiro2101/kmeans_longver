there are also links to be found between wind speed and wind direction , notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions the rossby waves are themselves a different wind speed from what we experience in the lower troposphere the fastest wind speed not related to tornadoes ever recorded was during the passage of tropical cyclone olivia on 10 april 1996 : an automatic weather station on barrow island , australia , registered a maximum wind gust of the wind gust was evaluated by the wmo evaluation panel who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010 a method of estimating speed is to use doppler on wheels to sense the wind speeds remotely , and , using this method , the figure of during the 1999 bridge creek–moore tornado in oklahoma on 3 may 1999 is often quoted as the highest-recorded surface wind speed , although another figure of has also been quoted for the same tornado a device consisting of a vertical pillar and three or four concave cups , the anemometer captures the horizontal movement of air particles ( wind speed ) stand it in the wind and each transmitter constantly beams high-frequency sound to its respective receiver built into the cavity is an array of ultrasonic transducers , which are used to create the separate standing-wave patterns at ultrasonic frequencies in the united states , the wind speed used in design is often referred to as a '' 3-second gust '' which is the highest sustained gust over a 3-second period having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50 ( asce 7-05 , updated to asce 7-16 ) this design wind speed is accepted by most building codes in the united states and often governs the lateral design of buildings and structures icao recommendations on use of the international system of units beaufort scale fujita scale and enhanced fujita scale prevailing wind saffir–simpson hurricane scale torro scale wind direction knot ( unit ) international building code ( promulgator of nbc 2005 ) american society of civil engineers ( promulgator of asce 7-05 , current version is asce 7-16 ) es : viento características físicas de los vientos
