one of the founding works of algebraic number theory , the disquisitiones arithmeticae ( latin : arithmetical investigations ) is a textbook of number theory written in latin by carl friedrich gauss in 1798 when gauss was 21 and first published in 1801 when he was 24 gauss brought the work of his predecessors together with his own original work into a systematic framework , filled in gaps , corrected unsound proofs , and extended the subject in numerous ways in a couple of papers in 1838 and 1839 peter gustav lejeune dirichlet proved the first class number formula , for quadratic forms ( later refined by his student leopold kronecker ) based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields , he proved the dirichlet unit theorem , a fundamental result in algebraic number theory he published important contributions to fermat 's last theorem , for which he proved the cases n & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 5 and n & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 14 , and to the quartic reciprocity he then had little more to publish on the subject ; but the emergence of hilbert modular forms in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area . a reciprocity law is a generalization of the law of quadratic reciprocity there are several different ways to express reciprocity laws it uses tools from homological algebra algebraic number theory is also used in the study of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds
