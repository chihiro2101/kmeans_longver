apart from the russian pressure upon bulgaria and serbia , another issue that triggered the formation of the league was the battle of deçiq of 1911 the serbs now wanted to stop the establishment of the albanian state thus the final agreement between the two countries stipulated that , in the event of a victorious war against the ottomans , bulgaria would receive all of macedonia south of the kriva palanka–ohrid line in essence , serbia was forced to exchange macedonia for albania , an issue that would play a key role in the eventual dissolution of the league in the spring of 1913 , when the great powers insisted upon the creation of the albanian state and denied serbia its territorial gains in that direction after initial success , serbia and especially greece realized the true purpose of imro and consequently a vicious guerrilla war , the so-called macedonian struggle broke out between bulgarian and greek backed armed groups within ottoman macedonia the entry of greece in the league however was essential for the allies , since greece , alone among the balkan states in possessing a major fleet , could preclude the mass transfer of ottoman reinforcements from asia directly into europe by sea another fact that helped the formation of the league was the evident inefficiency of the ottoman army the ottomans were at war with italy for a year ( 29 september 1911 to 18 october 1912 ) over libya after italy had launched an invasion of tripolitania reaction of the great powers germany , already heavily involved in the internal ottoman politics , officially opposed a war against the empire , but in its effort to win bulgaria for the central powers , and seeing the inevitability of ottoman disintegration , was playing with the idea to replace the balkan positions of the ottomans with a friendly greater bulgaria in its san stefano borders , an idea that was based on the german origin of the bulgarian king and his anti-russian sentiments however , the league 's triumph was short-lived the serbian and greek armies repulsed the bulgarian offensive and counterattacked , penetrating into bulgaria during the war , the greek king was assassinated in thessaloniki by alexandros schinas
