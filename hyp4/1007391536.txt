in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a however , product heterogeneity , market frictions or high fixed costs ( which make marginal-cost pricing unsustainable in the long run ) can allow for some degree of differential pricing to different consumers , even in fully competitive retail or industrial markets this usually entails using one or more means of preventing any resale : keeping the different price groups separate , making price comparisons difficult , or restricting pricing information another example of price discrimination is intellectual property , enforced by law and by technology some economists have argued that this is a form of price discrimination exercised by providing a means for consumers to reveal their willingness to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination frank , robert h , mcgraw-hill irwin , pp ( 2010 ) : microeconomics and behavior , 8th ed , mcgraw-hill irwin , p for example , airlines often offer multiple classes of seats on flights , such as first-class and economy class , with the first-class passengers receiving wine , beer and spirits with their ticket and the economy passengers offered only juice , pop , and water the two-part tariff is another form of price discrimination where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee for the use of the product discounted tickets requiring advance purchase and/or saturday stays however , these categories are not mutually exclusive or exhaustive complete price discrimination is most profitable , and requires the seller to have the most information about buyers an example is a high-speed internet connection shared by two consumers in a single building ; if one is willing to pay less than half the cost of connecting the building , and the other willing to make up the rest but not to pay the entire cost , then price discrimination can allow the purchase to take place this can also be shown geometrically with price discrimination , ( the bottom diagram ) , the demand curve is divided into two segments ( d1 and d2 ) the total revenue from the second segment is equal to the area e , c , q2 , q1 as usual , the profit maximizing output ( qt ) is determined by the intersection of the marginal cost curve ( mc ) with the marginal revenue curve for the total market ( mrt ) from the demand curve in each market we can determine the profit maximizing prices of p a and & nbsp ; p b it is also important to note that the marginal revenue in both markets at the optimal output levels must be equal , otherwise the firm could profit from transferring output over to whichever market is offering higher marginal revenue this is often done by assigning capacity to various booking classes , which sell for different prices and which may be linked to fare restrictions on the other hand , an airline may also apply differential pricing to '' the same seat '' over time , e.g meanwhile , in the recession following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the u.s , business travelers and corporate buyers made it clear to airlines that they were not going to be buying air travel at rates high enough to subsidize lower fares for non-business travelers thus , making coupons available enables , for instance , breakfast cereal makers to charge higher prices to price-insensitive customers , while still making some profit off customers who are more price-sensitive for certain products , premium products are priced at a level ( compared to '' regular '' or '' economy '' products ) that is well beyond their marginal cost of production these include discount coupons , rebates , bulk and quantity pricing , seasonal discounts , and frequent buyer discounts incentives for industrial buyers § 51.6 ( west supp ” ) ; joyce mcclements and cheryl thomas , public accommodations statutes : is ladies ' night out ?
