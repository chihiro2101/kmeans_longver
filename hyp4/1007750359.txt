additionally , the pathological appearance of outliers of a certain form appears in a variety of datasets , indicating that the causative mechanism for the data might differ at the extreme end ( king effect ) model-based methods which are commonly used for identification assume that the data are from a normal distribution , and identify observations which are deemed '' unlikely '' based on mean and standard deviation : chauvenet 's criterion grubbs 's test for outliers dixon 's q test astm e178 standard practice for dealing with outlying observations mahalanobis distance and leverage are often used to detect outliers , especially in the development of linear regression models – appendix 21 , according to the editorial note on page 515 some approaches may use the distance to the k-nearest neighbors to label observations as outliers or non-outliers the strength of this method lies in the fact that it takes into account a data set 's standard deviation , average and provides a statistically determined rejection zone ; thus providing an objective method to determine if a data point is an outlier journal of the royal statistical society series b ( methodological ) , vol some estimators are highly sensitive to outliers , notably estimation of covariance matrices even when a normal distribution model is appropriate to the data being analyzed , outliers are expected for large sample sizes and should not automatically be discarded if that is the case the two common approaches to exclude outliers are truncation ( or trimming ) and winsorising as illustrated by the figure , the q-relaxed intersection corresponds to the set of all x which belong to all sets except q of them and tarassenko , l neural computation 6 , 270–284 .
