21 comae berenices ( proper name kissin ) is a double star with nearly equal components and an orbital period of 26 years the coma cluster contains at least eight spectroscopic binary , and the constellation has seven eclipsing binary : cc , dd , ek , rw , rz , ss and ux comae berenices triple stars include 12 comae berenices , 17 comae berenices , kr comae berenices and struve 1639 four ( sn 1940b , sn 1969h , sn 1987e and sn 1999gs ) were in the ngc 4725 galaxy , and another four were discovered in the m99 galaxy ( ngc 4254 ) : sn 1967h , sn 1972q , sn 1986i and sn 2014l sn & nbsp ; 1979c , discovered in 1979 , retained its original x-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading in visible light coma berenices has seven known exoplanets the cluster is spread over a huge region ( more than five degrees across ) near gamma comae berenices it was discovered by william herschel in 1784 its brightest members are ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 , both with a magnitude of 13 ; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer m85 ( ngc 4382 ) , considered elliptical or lenticular , is one of the cluster 's brighter members at magnitude nine m100 ( ngc 4321 ) , a magnitude-nine spiral galaxy seen face-on , is one of the cluster 's brightest recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy 's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions , leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago ngc 4314 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy at a distance of 40 million light-years ngc 4565 has been nicknamed the needle galaxy because when seen in full , it appears as a narrow streak of light like many edge-on spiral galaxies , it has a prominent dust lane and a central bulge ngc 4651 , about the size of the milky way , has tidal stellar streams gravitationally stripped from a smaller , satellite galaxy it is about 62 million light-years away as of 2009 , it had the most intense gamma ray spectrum of the sixty known gamma-ray blazars in 1886 , spanish artist luis ricardo falero created a mezzotint print personifying coma berenices alongside virgo and leo the swedish poet gunnar ekelöf wrote the lines '' your friend the comet combed his hair with the leonids / berenice let her hair hang down from the sky '' in a 1933 poem ( la paz : universidad mayor de san andrés , 1967 ) '' the irish poet w
