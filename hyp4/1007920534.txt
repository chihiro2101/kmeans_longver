for example , starting with baking soda and monocalcium phosphate , the reaction produces carbon dioxide by the following stoichiometry : :14 nahco 3 + 5 ca ( h 2 po 4 ) 2 → 14 co 2 + ca 5 ( po 4 ) 3 oh + 7 na 2 hpo 4 + 13 h 2 o image : calcium dihydrogen phosphate.png thumb 220px monocalcium phosphate ( '' mcp '' ) is a common acid component in domestic baking powders double-acting baking powders work in two phases ; once when cold , and once when hot for example , rumford baking powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid further release of gas requires the batter to be heated above 140 & nbsp ; °f ( 60 & nbsp ; °c ) high-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate , sodium aluminium phosphate , and sodium acid pyrophosphate when amelia simmons published american cookery ( 1792 ) , the first american cookbook , the recipes she included used three possible types of leavening : baker 's yeast , emptins ( from the leavings of brewer 's yeast ) , and pearlash at that time , the mechanisms underlying the action of yeasts and other leavenings were not understood , and reliable commercial products were not available pound cakes combined butter , sugar , and flour and eggs , and were particularly dense several recipes in the compilation cookbook practical american cookery ( 1855 ) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough when the third edition of miss beecher 's domestic receipt book appeared in 1858 , it included 8 types of leaveners , only two of which could be made at home the next step , the development of baking powder , created a system where the gas-producing reactions could be delayed until needed his formulation included bicarbonate of soda and tartaric acid , mixed with starch to absorb moisture and prevent the other ingredients from reacting in america , eben norton horsford , a student of justus von liebig , set out to create a flour fortifier and leavening agent its initial reaction , when exposed to water , released carbon dioxide and produced dicalcium phosphate , which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide in 1859 , horsford and george wilson formed the rumford chemical works , named in honor of count rumford in 1864 , he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or '' bread preparation '' in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener they were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans in 2006 the rumford chemical works in east providence , rhode island were designated a national historic chemical landmark in recognition of baking powder 's impact in making baking easier , quicker , and more reliable they may now use combinations of acids , or different acids altogether calumet held about 1/3 of the american baking powder market , with clabber girl ( which produces the clabber girl , rumford , and davis brands of baking powder , among others ) dominating 2/3 when excessive acid is present , some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda moisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time , and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks , to promote their new products , to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them , and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder in one test , six u.s brands were used to bake white cake , cream biscuits , and chocolate cookies where a recipe already uses buttermilk or yogurt , baking soda can be used without cream of tartar ( or with less )
