beyond consistency , relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system a model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set , which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system , in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system by constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom , we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem the system has at least two different models â€“ one is the natural numbers ( isomorphic to any other countably infinite set ) , and another is the real numbers ( isomorphic to any other set with the cardinality of the continuum ) however it can be shown to be complete this was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century , in particular in subjects based around homological algebra the explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with one such problem was the continuum hypothesis many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century , including non-euclidean geometry , the foundations of real analysis , cantor 's set theory , frege 's work on foundations , and hilbert 's 'new ' use of axiomatic method as a research tool an example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the natural numbers , which is only partially axiomatized by the peano axioms ( described below ) for example , a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic ( i.e it might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the peano axioms any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory , but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions , and even if it is , it is not likely to shed light on anything he chose the axioms , in the language of a single unary function symbol s ( short for '' successor '' ) , for the set of natural numbers to be : there is a natural number 0
