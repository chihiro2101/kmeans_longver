in 1928 , british raf college cranwell cadet frank whittle formally submitted his ideas for a turbojet to his superiors in october 1929 he developed his ideas further on 16 january 1930 in england , whittle submitted his first patent ( granted in 1932 ) 347,206 ( filed : 16 january 1930 ) the patent showed a two-stage axial compressor feeding a single-sided centrifugal compressor practical axial compressors were made possible by ideas from a.a whittle was unable to interest the government in his invention , and development continued at a slow pace in germany , hans von ohain patented a similar engine in 1935 the turbine exit gases still contain considerable energy that is converted in the propelling nozzle to a high speed jet for concorde less fuel was required to produce a given thrust for a mile at mach 2.0 than a modern high-bypass turbofan such as general electric cf6 at its mach 0.86 optimum speed pre-jet commercial aircraft were designed with as many as four engines in part because of concerns over in-flight failures non-uk jet engines built in the 1930s and 1940s had to be overhauled every 10 or 20 hours due to creep failure and other types of damage to blades british engines , however , utilised nimonic alloys which allowed extended use without overhaul , engines such as the rolls-royce welland and rolls-royce derwent , '' world encyclopedia of aero engines – 5th edition '' by bill gunston , sutton publishing , 2006 , p.192 and by 1949 the de havilland goblin , being type tested for 500 hours without maintenance intakes have ranged from '' zero-length '' '' trade-offs in jet inlet design '' sobester , journal of aircraft vol.44 , no.3 , may–june 2007 , fig.12 on the pratt & whitney tf33 turbofan installation in the lockheed c-141 starlifter , to the twin , 65 feet-long , intakes on the north american xb-70 valkyrie , each feeding three engines with an intake airflow of about 800 lb/sec the compressor is driven by the turbine less than 25 % of the air is typically used for combustion , as an overall lean mixture is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits in the first stage , the turbine is largely an impulse turbine ( similar to a pelton wheel ) and rotates because of the impact of the hot gas stream in a convergent nozzle , the ducting narrows progressively to a throat the nozzle pressure ratio on a turbojet is high enough at higher thrust settings to cause the nozzle to choke mit.edu unified : thermodynamics and propulsion prof the efficiency of a gas turbine is increased by raising the overall pressure ratio , requiring higher-temperature compressor materials , and raising the turbine entry temperature , requiring better turbine materials and/or improved vane/blade cooling turbojet systems are complex systems therefore to secure optimal function of such system , there is a call for the newer models being developed to advance its control systems to implement the newest knowledge from the areas of automation , so increase its safety and effectiveness andoga , , l judičák technical university of košice , department of cybernetics and artificial intelligence , košice , slovakia technical university of košice , department of environmental studies and information engineering , košice , ) )
