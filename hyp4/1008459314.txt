genetic recombination is catalysis by many different enzymes the rad51 protein is required for mitosis and meiosis recombination , whereas the dna repair protein , dmc1 , is specific to meiotic recombination in the archaea , the ortholog of the bacterial reca protein is rada ; bacterial recombination in bacteria there are : regular bacterial recombination , as well as noneffective transfer of genetic material , expressed as unsuccessful transfer or abortive transfer which is any bacterium dna transfer of the donor cell recipients who have set the incoming dna as part of the genetic material of the recipient this technique is important to biomedical researchers as it allows them to study the effects of specific genes in the case of pathogenic viruses , multiplicity reactivation may be an adaptive benefit to the virus since it allows the repair of dna damages caused by exposure to the oxidizing environment produced during host infection the figure shows that two of the four chromatids present early in meiosis ( prophase i ) are paired with each other and able to interact recombination , in this version of the model , is initiated by a double-strand break ( or gap ) shown in the dna molecule ( chromatid ) at the top of the first figure in this article for instance , an inter-strand cross-link ( caused by exposure to a cross-linking agent such as mitomycin c ) can be repaired by hrr the nco recombinants ( illustrated on the left in the figure ) are produced by a process referred to as “ synthesis dependent strand annealing ” ( sdsa ) recombination events of the nco/sdsa type appear to be more common than the co/dhj type mehrotra s , mckim ks 2006 nov 24 ; 2 ( 11 ) : e200 pmid : 17166055 ; pmcid : pmc1657055 the nco/sdsa pathway contributes little to genetic variation , since the arms of the chromosomes flanking the recombination event remain in the parental configuration heterochiasmy occurs when recombination rates differ between the sexes of a species in the retrovirus ( ( + ) ssrna ) ( e.g hiv ) , damage in the rna genome appears to be avoided during reverse transcriptase by strand switching , a form of recombination recombination can occur infrequently between animal viruses of the same species but of divergent lineages when replicating its ( + ) ssrna genome , the poliovirus rna-dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) is able to carry out recombination recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genetic variability within coronaviruses , as well as the ability of coronavirus species to jump from one host to another and , infrequently , for the emergence of novel species , although the mechanism of recombination in is unclear
