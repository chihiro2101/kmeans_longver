organistrum construatur ( how the organistrum is made ) , scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra potissimum , 3 vols martin gerbert ( st '' modern language notes 46/1 ( jan another 10th-century treatise thought to have mentioned an instrument like a hurdy-gurdy is an arabic musical compendium written by al zirikli during the renaissance , the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument ( along with the bagpipe ) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end , c and g , or g and d ) lirnyky were categorised as beggars by the russian authorities and fell under harsh repressive measures if they were caught performing in the streets of major cities until 1902 , when the authorities were asked by ethnographers attending the 12th all-russian archaeological conference to stop persecuting them although the song does not use a hurdy-gurdy , the repeated reference to the instrument in the song 's lyrics sparked curiosity and interest among young people , eventually resulting in an annual hurdy-gurdy music festival in the olympic peninsula area of the state of washington each september about the over the water hurdy-gurdy association from the 'over the water ' website revivals have been underway for many years as well in austria , belarus , belgium , the czech republic , germany , italy , the netherlands , poland , portugal , russia , slovakia , spain , sweden and ukraine in france , a player is called un sonneur de vielle ( literally : '' a sounder of vielle '' ) , un vielleux or un vielleur such common terms include the following : trompette : the highest-pitched drone string that features the buzzing bridge mouche : the drone string pitched a fourth or fifth below the trompette petit bourdon : the drone string pitched an octave below the trompette gros bourdon : the drone string pitched an octave below the mouche chanterelle ( s ) : melody string ( s ) , also called chanters or chanter strings in english chien : ( literally '' dog '' ) , the buzzing bridge tirant : a small peg set in the instrument 's tailpiece that is used to control the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge according to the oxford english dictionary , the mid 18th century origin of the term hurdy-gurdy is onomatopoeia in origin , after the repetitive warble in pitch that characterizes instruments with solid wooden wheels that have warped due to changes in humidity or after the sound of the buzzing-bridge the instrument is sometimes more descriptively called a wheel fiddle in english , but this term is rarely used among players of the instrument the hungarian name tekerőlant and the alternative forgólant both mean '' turning lute '' the six-stringed french vielle à roue is the best-known and most common sort there are two primary body styles for contemporary instruments : guitar-bodied and lute-backed the melody string ( s ) ( french chanterelle ( s ) , hungarian dallamhúr ( ok ) ) are stopped with tangents attached to keys that change the vibration length of the string , much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar in some types of hurdy-gurdy , notably the french vielle à roue ( 'fiddle with a wheel ' ) and the hungarian tekerőlant ( tekerő for short ) , makers have added a buzzing bridge—called a chien ( french for dog ) or recsegő ( hungarian for '' buzzer '' ) —on one drone string when the crank is struck , the hammer lifts up suddenly and vibrates against the soundboard , producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect , especially in dance pieces the percussion is transmitted to the wheel by striking the handle with the thumb , fingers or base of the thumb at one or more of four points in the revolution of the wheel ( often described in terms of the clock face , 12 , 3 , 6 and 9 o'clock ) to achieve the desired rhythm regional types of hurdy-gurdies since the renaissance can also be classified based on wheel size and the presence or absence ( and type ) of a buzzing bridge two to three drone strings and one or two chromatic melody strings tyrolian drehleier ( austria ) no buzzing bridge lira korbowa ( poland ) these instruments generally have a narrow keybox with drone strings that run outside the keybox two forms : one has a standard drone-melody arrangement , while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox no buzzing bridge zanfona ( spain ) some older examples had a diatonic keyboard , and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard zanfonas are usually tuned to the key of c major , with the melody strings tuned in unison to g above the middle c on the piano both diatonic and chromatic forms are found the data exchange of the
