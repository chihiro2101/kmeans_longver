in the 1960s through the 1970s , paul boyer , a ucla professor , developed the binding change , or flip-flop , mechanism theory , which postulated that atp synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in atp synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit the research group of john e for elucidating this , boyer and walker shared half of the 1997 nobel prize in chemistry according to the current model of atp synthesis ( known as the alternating catalytic model ) , the transmembrane potential created by ( h+ ) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain , drives the ( h+ ) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the f o region of atp synthase the c-ring is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk ( consisting primarily of the gamma subunit ) , causing it to rotate within the alpha 3 beta 3 of f 1 causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that lead to atp synthesis the enzyme then undergoes a change in shape and forces these molecules together , with the active site in the resulting '' tight '' state ( shown in red ) binding the newly produced atp molecule with very high affinity in respiring bacteria under physiological conditions , atp synthase , in general , runs in the opposite direction , creating atp while using the proton motive force created by the electron transfer chain as a source of energy the overall process of creating energy in this fashion is termed oxidative phosphorylation some of the most commonly used atp synthase inhibitors are oligomycin and dccd most of these proteins have homologues in other eukaryotes the enzyme is integrated into thylakoid membrane ; the cf 1 -part sticks into stroma , where dark reactions of photosynthesis ( also called the light-independent reactions or the calvin cycle ) and atp synthesis take place a euglenozoa atp synthase forms a dimer with a boomerang-shaped f 1 head like other mitochondrial atp synthases , but the f o subcomplex has many unique subunits
