consider a simple example : a class of students takes a 100-item true/false test on a subject if there were no luck ( good or bad ) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students – then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test , and there would be no regression toward the mean therefore , a student who was lucky and over-performed their ability on the first test is more likely to have a worse score on the second test than a better score london : fourth estate , 2008 the concept of regression comes from genetics and was popularized by sir francis galton during the late 19th century with the publication of regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature galton coined the term '' regression '' to describe an observable fact in the inheritance of multi-factorial quantitative genetic traits : namely that the offspring of parents who lie at the tails of the distribution will tend to lie closer to the centre , the mean , of the distribution he quantified this trend , and in doing so invented linear regression analysis , thus laying the groundwork for much of modern statistical modelling '' this is incorrect , since a child receives its genetic make-up exclusively from its parents exceptionally tall individuals must be homozygous for increased height mutations at a large proportion of these loci in contrast , the term '' regression to the mean '' is now often used to describe the phenomenon by which an initial sampling bias may disappear as new , repeated , or larger samples display sample means that are closer to the true underlying population mean the best way to combat this effect is to divide the group randomly into a treatment group that receives the treatment , and a control group that does not the baseball player with the highest batting average by the all-star break is more likely to have a lower average than a higher average over the second half of the season the educators decided to stop praising and keep punishing on this basis such a decision was a mistake , because regression toward the mean is not based on cause and effect , but rather on random error in a natural distribution around a mean consider the students again those expectations are closer to the mean than the first day scores open letters , journal of the american statistical association , 29 , 198–199 however , it was also noted that many of the supposedly best schools in the commonwealth , such as brookline high school ( with 18 national merit scholarship finalists ) were declared to have failed in the contrary situation , when one happens to perform high above average , their performance will also tend to return to their average level later on ; the change will be perceived as a deterioration and any initial praise following the first performance as a cause of that deterioration just because criticizing or praising precedes the regression toward the mean , the act of criticizing or of praising is falsely attributed causality for example , carmelo anthony of the nba 's denver nuggets had an outstanding rookie season in 2004 it was so outstanding that he could not be expected to repeat it : in 2005 , anthony 's numbers had dropped from his rookie season because popular lore has focused on regression toward the mean as an account of declining performance of athletes from one season to the next , it has usually overlooked the fact that such regression can also account for improved performance in no sense does the future event '' compensate for '' or '' even out '' the previous event , though this is assumed in the gambler 's fallacy ( and the variant law of averages ) for example , following a run of 10 heads on a flip of a fair coin ( a rare , extreme event ) , regression to the mean states that the next run of heads will likely be less than 10 , while the law of large numbers states that in the long term , this event will likely average out , and the average fraction of heads will tend to 1/2 in this formalization , the joint distribution of x 1 and x 2 is said to exhibit reversion toward the mean if , for every number c , we have : & mu ; & nbsp ; ≤ & nbsp ; ex 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; x 1 & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; c & nbsp ; 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; x 1 & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; c , and : & mu ; & nbsp ; ≥ & nbsp ; ex 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; x 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ex 1 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; x 1 & nbsp ; < & nbsp ; c this definition is '' general '' in the sense that every bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions exhibits reversion toward the mean article , including a diagram of galton 's original data & nbsp ; 176–183 amanda wachsmuth , leland wilkinson , gerard e gary smith , what the luck : the surprising role of chance in our everyday lives , new york : overlook , london : duckworth .
