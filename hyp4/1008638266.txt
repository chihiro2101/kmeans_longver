the working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive fluid ( which can be a liquid or an ionized gas called a plasma ) by the lorentz force , resulting from the cross product of an electric current ( motion of charge carriers accelerated by an electric field applied between two electrodes ) with a perpendicular magnetic field additionally , the mhd design eliminates many of the wear and friction pieces of the powertrain with a directly driven propeller by an engine such a large generator is not required when an engine directly drives a propeller the cruise speed was about 0.4 meter per second ( 15 inches per second ) during the test in the bay of santa barbara , california , in accordance with theoretical predictions rizzuto ( ipc science and technology , 1980 ) , pp in 1991 , the world 's first full-size prototype yamato 1 was completed in japan after 6 years of r & d by the ship & ocean foundation ( later known as the ocean policy research foundation ) the ship successfully carried a crew of ten plus passengers at speeds of up to in kobe harbour in june 1992 first studies of the interaction of plasmas with hypersonic speed around vehicles date back to the late 1950s , with the concept of a new kind of thermal protection system for space capsules during high-speed reentry hypersonic ionized flow interacts with the magnetic field , inducing eddy currents in the plasma shock wave mitigation for thermal control and reduction of the wave drag and form drag airflow velocity reduction upstream to feed a scramjet by the use of an mhd generator section combined with an mhd accelerator downstream at the exhaust nozzle , powered by the generator through an mhd bypass system such studies covers a field of resistive mhd with magnetic reynolds number â‰ª 1 using nonthermal weakly ionized gases , making the development of demonstrators much more difficult to realize than for mhd in liquids nonetheless , considering the current problem of the electric power solved ( for example with the availability of a still missing multi-megawatt compact fusion power ) , one could imagine future aircraft of a new kind silently powered by mhd accelerators , able to ionize and direct enough air downward to lift several tonnes depending on the propellant used , it can be seeded with alkali such as potassium or caesium to improve its electrical conductivity in valhalla rising , clive cussler writes the same drive into the powering of captain nemo 's nautilus
