in january 2001 , a still slower 1.3 & nbsp ; ghz model was added to the range , but over the next twelve months , intel gradually started reducing amd 's leadership in performance in april 2001 a 1.7 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 was launched , the first model to provide performance clearly superior to the old pentium iii the new chipset allowed the pentium 4 to quickly replace the pentium iii , becoming the top-selling mainstream processor on the market the willamette code name is derived from the willamette valley region of oregon , where a large number of intel 's manufacturing facilities are located in january 2002 , intel released pentium 4s with a new core code named '' northwood '' at speeds of 1.6 & nbsp ; ghz , 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz , 2 & nbsp ; ghz and 2.2 & nbsp ; ghz amd 's athlon xp 1800+ processor , tech report , october 9 , 2001 wasson , scott and brown , andrew athlon xp 2000+ , january 7 , 2002 this was particularly so in mid-2002 , when amd 's changeover to its 130 & nbsp ; nm production process did not help the initial '' thoroughbred a '' revision athlon xp cpus to clock high enough to overcome the advantages of northwood in the 2.4 to 2.8 & nbsp ; ghz range by shuffling two ( ideally differing ) program instructions to simultaneously execute through a single physical processor core , the goal is to best utilize processor resources that would have otherwise been unused from the traditional approach of having these single instructions wait for each other to execute singularly through the core because of this , motherboard manufacturers did not initially build motherboards with agp for opterons this became known as sudden northwood death syndrome ( snds ) , which was caused by electromigration northwood ( extreme edition ) it shared the same gallatin core as the xeon mp , though in a socket 478 form factor ( as opposed to socket 603 for the xeon mp ) and with an 800 & nbsp ; mt/s bus , twice as fast as that of the xeon mp while intel maintained that the extreme edition was aimed at gamers , critics viewed it as an attempt to steal the athlon 64 's launch thunder , nicknaming it the '' emergency edition '' although never a particularly good seller , especially since it was released in a time when amd was asserting near total dominance in the processor performance race , the pentium 4 extreme edition established a new position within intel 's product line , that of an enthusiast oriented chip with the highest-end specifications offered by intel chips , along with unlocked multipliers to allow for easier overclocking the fastest mass-produced prescott-based pentium 4s were clocked at 3.8 & nbsp ; ghz prescott 's inability to achieve greater clock speeds was attributed to the very high power consumption and heat output of the processor in fact , prescott 's power and heat characteristics were only slightly higher than those of northwood of the same speed and nearly equal to the gallatin-based extreme editions , but since those processors had already been operating near the limits of what was considered thermally acceptable , this still posed a major issue glaskowsky , peter n '' prescott pushes pipelining limits '' the process has features such as strained silicon transistors and low-Îº carbon-doped silicon oxide ( cdo ) dielectric , which is also known as organosilicate glass ( osg ) two low-end intel 64-enabled prescotts , based on the 5x5/5x9 series , were also released with model numbers 506 and 516 5x0 , 5x0j , and 5x1 series prescott incorporates hyper-threading in order to speed up some processes that use multithreaded software , such as video editing it features intel 64 , the xd & nbsp ; bit , eist ( enhanced intel speedstep technology ) , tm2 ( for processors at 3.6 & nbsp ; ghz and above ) , and 2 & nbsp ; mb of l2 cache it has a 65 & nbsp ; nm core and features the same 31-stage pipeline as prescott , 800 & nbsp ; mt/s fsb , intel 64 , hyper-threading , but no virtualization technology to distinguish cedar mill cores from prescott cores with the same features , intel added 1 to their model numbers however , it was cancelled a few months after the release of prescott due to extremely high tdps ( a 2.8 & nbsp ; ghz tejas emitted 150 w of heat , compared to around 80 w for a northwood of the same speed , and 100 w for a comparably clocked prescott ) and development on the netburst microarchitecture as a whole ceased , with the exception of the dual-core pentium d and pentium extreme edition and the cedar mill-based pentium 4 ht the future of prescott : when moore gives you lemons at ars technica prescott vs
