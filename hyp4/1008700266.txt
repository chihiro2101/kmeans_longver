a storage which can communicate a message over time as well as space the portion of a storage medium , such as a track or band , that is accessible to a given reading or writing station or head television channels such as north american tv channel 2 55.25 & nbsp ; mhz , channel 13 211.25 & nbsp ; mhz since 2006 television broadcasting has switched to digital modulation ( digital television ) which uses image compression to transmit a television signal in a much smaller bandwidth , so each of these '' physical channels '' has been divided into multiple '' virtual channels '' each carrying a dtv channel for example , a repeater that transmits on 146.94 & nbsp ; mhz typically listens for a ham transmitting on 146.34 & nbsp ; mhz a sequence of random numbers might also be added to simulate external interference and/or electronic noise in the receiver statistical and physical modelling can be combined in information theory , it is common to start with memoryless channels in which the output probability distribution only depends on the current channel input binary ) or analog the model may reflect the following channel impairments : noise model , for example additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , a linear continuous memoryless model phase noise model interference model , for example crosstalk ( co-channel interference ) and intersymbol interference ( isi ) distortion model , for example a non-linear channel model causing intermodulation distortion ( imd ) frequency response model , including attenuation and phase-shift group delay model modelling of underlying physical layer transmission techniques , for example a complex-valued equivalent baseband model of modulation and frequency response radio frequency propagation model , for example log-distance path loss model fading model , for example rayleigh fading , ricean fading , log-normal shadow fading and frequency selective ( dispersive ) fading doppler shift model , which combined with fading results in a time-variant system ray tracing models , which attempt to model the signal propagation and distortions for specified transmitter-receiver geometries , terrain types , and antennas mobility models , which also causes a time-variant system digital ( discrete ) or analog ( continuous ) channel transmission medium , for example a fibre channel multiplexing computer network virtual channel simplex communication , duplex communication or half duplex communication channel return channel uplink or downlink ( upstream or downstream channel ) broadcast channel , unicast or multicast multi-terminal channels , with application to cellular systems : see also network topology in networks , as opposed to point-to-point communication , the communication media is shared between multiple nodes ( terminals ) that sends data addressed to all users in the network from the above 4 basic multi-terminal channels , multiple access channel is the only one whose capacity region is known & nbsp ; 379–423 and 623–656 , ( july and october , 1948 ) amin shokrollahi , ldpc codes : an introduction
