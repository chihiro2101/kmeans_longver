a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available these included a patented induction system by thomas edison allowing a telegraph on a running train to connect with telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks , a william preece induction telegraph system for sending messages across bodies of water , and several operational and proposed telegraphy and voice earth conduction systems when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901 the wireless revolution has been driven by advances in radio frequency ( rf ) and microwave engineering , including the transition from analog to digital rf technology along with the migration to metal–oxide–semiconductor ( mos ) based multi-carrier rf power amplifiers , which enabled a substantial increase in voice traffic along with the delivery of digital data such as text messaging , images and streaming media or dielectric '' light pipes '' common examples of wireless equipment include : tech target – definition of wireless – posted by margaret rouse ( april 2 control and traffic control systems infrared and ultrasonic remote control devices professional lmr ( land mobile radio ) and smr ( specialized mobile radio ) typically used by business , industrial and public safety entities the amateur radio service ( ham radio ) cordless computer peripherals : the cordless mouse is a common example ; wireless headphones , keyboards , and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless using technology such as wireless usb or bluetooth satellite television : is broadcast from satellites in geostationary orbit & marakas , g.m wireless network industry report 2007 , wireless-nets , ltd this allows us to detect relevant quantities , monitor and collect data , formulate clear user displays , and to perform decision-making functions f.l das , john wiley , new york , 2004 automation and robotics research institute 2013 wireless data communications are used to span a distance beyond the capabilities of typical cabling in point-to-point communication and point-to-multipoint communication , to provide a backup communications link in case of normal network failure , to link portable or temporary workstations , to overcome situations where normal cabling is difficult or financially impractical , or to remotely connect mobile users or networks the wall street journal
