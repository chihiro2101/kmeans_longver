there are several possible solutions to the equations of general relativity , and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe alexander friedmann proposed several solutions in 1922 , as did georges lemaître in 1927 when einstein found that his general relativity equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding at the present and contracting in the far future , he added to those equations what he called a cosmological constant ⁠— ⁠essentially a constant energy density , unaffected by any expansion or contraction ⁠— ⁠whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static these are called , respectively , the flat , open and closed universes starting in 1998 , observations of supernovas in distant galaxy have been interpreted as consistent with a universe whose accelerating universe if \omega > 1 , the geometry of space is closed like the surface of a sphere the sum of the angles of a triangle exceeds 180 degrees and there are no parallel lines ; all lines eventually meet , negatively curved like the surface of a saddle the geometry of such a universe is hyperbolic even without dark energy , a negatively curved universe expands forever , with gravity negligibly slowing the rate of expansion this option has been ruled out by observations if the average density of the universe exactly equals the critical density so that \omega 1 , then the geometry of the universe is flat : as in euclidean geometry , the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and parallel lines continuously maintain the same distance wmap - fate of the universe , wmap 's universe , nasa . big freeze or heat death over infinite time , there would be a spontaneous entropy decrease by the poincaré recurrence theorem , thermal fluctuations , and the fluctuation theorem in the special case of phantom energy , which has supposed negative kinetic energy that would result in a higher rate of acceleration than other cosmological constants predict , a more sudden big rip could occur this theory posits that the universe currently exists in a false vacuum and that it could become a true vacuum at any moment if the theory of inflation is true , the universe went through an episode dominated by a different form of dark energy in the first moments of the big bang ; but inflation ended , indicating an equation of state far more complex than those assumed so far for present-day dark energy none of these theoretic endings for the universe are certain observational constraints on theories
