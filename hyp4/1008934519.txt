several software applications are available on the pc , mac and linux platforms for producing hdr files and tone mapped images notable titles include : adobe photoshop affinity photo aurora hdr dynamic photo hdr easyhdr gimp hdr photostudio luminance hdr nik collection hdr efex pro oloneo photoengine ptgui sns-hdr this is different from traditional digital images , which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print hdr images often do n't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range color film capable of directly recording high-dynamic-range images was developed by charles wyckoff and eg & g '' in the course of a contract with the united states air force '' it has been used to photograph nuclear explosions , for astronomical photography , for spectrographic research , and for medical imaging technion researchers filed for a patent on this concept in 1991 , and several related patents in 1992 and 1993 also in 1991 , georges cornuéjols introduced the hdr+ image principle by non-linear accumulation of images to increase the sensitivity of the camera : for low-light environments , several successive images are accumulated , thus increasing the signal to noise ratio modern hdr imaging uses a completely different approach , based on making a high-dynamic-range luminance or light map using only global image operations ( across the entire image ) , and then tone mapping the result global hdr was first introduced in 1993 '' compositing multiple pictures of the same scene '' , by steve mann , in is & t 's 46th annual conference , cambridge , massachusetts , may 9–14 , 1993 resulting in a mathematical theory of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter that was published in 1995 by steve mann and rosalind picard steve mann developed and patented the global-hdr method for producing digital images having extended dynamic range at the mit media lab ) , into an hdr image the image array generated by the first step of mann 's process is called a lightspace image , lightspace picture , or radiance map in feb 2001 , the dynamic ranger technique was demonstrated , using multiple photos with different exposure levels to accomplish high dynamic range similar to the naked eye
