the equation employed here is : : 4 bits ( 1st character ) + 14 bits ( characters 2 & ndash ; 8 ) + 18 bits ( characters 9 & ndash ; 20 ) + 3 bits ( characters 21 & ndash ; 23 ) + 6 bits ( bonus for upper case , lower case , and alphanumeric ) 45 bits ( this calculation does not take into account that this is a well-known quote from the operetta h.m.s in the case of four word phrases , actual entropy rarely exceeds 30 bits passphrases differ from passwords such passwords may be adequate for various applications ( if frequently changed , if chosen using an appropriate policy , if not found in dictionaries , if sufficiently random , and/or if the system prevents online guessing , etc in 2012 , two cambridge university researchers analyzed passphrases from the amazon payphrase system and found that a significant percentage are easy to guess due to common cultural references such as movie names and sports teams , losing much of the potential of using long passwords typical advice about choosing a passphrase includes suggestions that it should be : long enough to be hard to guess not a famous quotation from literature , holy books , et cetera hard to guess by intuitionâ€”even by someone who knows the user well easy to remember and type accurately for better security , any easily memorable encoding at the user 's own level can be applied another is to choose two phrases , turn one into an acronym , and include it in the second , making the final passphrase the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog , becomes tqbfjotld it has appeared in public and so should be avoided by everyone another supplementary approach to frustrating brute-force attacks is to derive the key from the passphrase using a key derivation function , such as pbkdf2 as described in rfc 2898 if backward compatibility with microsoft lan manager is not needed , in versions of windows nt ( including windows 2000 , windows xp and later ) , a passphrase can be used as a substitute for a windows password
