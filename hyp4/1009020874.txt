however , post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image michael reilly , '' calculating the speed of sight '' , new scientist , july 28 , 2006 this manifests itself in a number of ways , but the most important in terms of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion modern tv sets can display multiple field rates ( 50 , 59.94 , or 60 , in either interlaced or progressive scan ) while accepting power at various frequencies ( often the operating range is specified as 48–62 & nbsp ; hz ) the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution , while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display the ntsc standard represented a major technical achievement a number of such mechanical television systems were being used experimentally in the 1920s the best-known was john logie baird 's , which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in britain for several years converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances in this time thousands of television sets had been sold '' television '' , the world book encyclopedia 2003 : 119 le blanc , '' etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses '' , la lumière electrique , vol 11 , december 1 , 1880 , pp & nbsp ;

rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use , and the fcc set aside a large section of these new uhf bands for television broadcast demonstrated its line-sequential system , while philco demonstrated a dot-sequential system based on its beam-index tube-based '' apple '' tube technology , but by 1951 there were well over 10 & nbsp ;
