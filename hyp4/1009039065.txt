eric 's mother , charlotte zimels , was born in 1897 in kolomyia , pokuttya ( modern ukraine ) she came from an ashkenazi jewish family at that time kolomyya was part of austria-hungary eric kandel was born on november 7 , 1929 , in vienna he attended brooklyn 's erasmus hall high school in the new york city school system '' my grandfather and i liked each other a great deal , and he readily convinced me that he should tutor me in hebrew during the summer of 1939 so that i might be eligible for a scholarship at the yeshiva of flatbush , an excellent hebrew parochial school that offered both secular and religious studies at a very high level the world of neuroscience was opened up to kandel when he met anna kris , whose parents ernst kris and marianne rie were psychoanalysts the researchers kandel interacted with were contemplating the technical challenges of intracellular recordings of the electrical activity of the relatively small neurons of the vertebrate brain kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage this decision was not without risk : many senior biologists and psychologists believed that nothing useful could be learned about human memory by studying invertebrate physiology by this time it was known that long-term memory , unlike short-term memory , involved the synthesis of new proteins in 1974 kandel moved his lab to columbia university and became founding director of the center for neurobiology and behavior it was soon found that the neurotransmitter serotonin , acting to produce the second messenger camp , is involved in the molecular basis of sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex . continuing work at columbia university kandel has been a member of the national academy of sciences since 1974 he also said it was '' certainly not an austrian nobel , it was a jewish-american nobel '' the street was ultimately renamed in 2012 he also proposed a symposium on the response of austria to national socialism kandel 's 2012 book , the age of insight—as expressed in its subtitle , the quest to understand the unconscious in art , mind , and brain , from vienna 1900 to the present —represents a wide-ranging historical attempt to place vienna at the root of cultural modernism harvey prize ( 1993 ) ralph w . kandel , eric r list of jewish nobel laureates kandel 's united states patents
