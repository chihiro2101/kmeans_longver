the genus name phytophthora comes from the greek – , meaning : '' plant '' – plus the greek , meaning : '' decay , ruin , perish '' . life cycle , signs and symptoms jpg right thumb ripe tomato infected with blight image : tomato late blight fruit cluster ( 5816739612 ) people can observe phytophthora infestans produce sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of potato stems and leaves this can have devastating effects by destroying entire crops the genome was found to be considerably larger ( 240 mbp ) than that of most other phytophthora species whose genomes have been sequenced ; phytophthora sojae has a 95 mbp genome and phytophthora ramorum had a 65 mbp genome about 18,000 genes were detected within the p some rxlr proteins are avirulence proteins , meaning that they can be detected by the plant and lead to a hypersensitive response which restricts the growth of the pathogen . origin and diversity of p infestans , although others have proposed its origin to be in the andes , which is also the origin of potatoes infestans , namely p ipomoeae are endemic to central mexico on the other hand , the only close relative found in south america , namely p only in mexico and scandinavia , however , is oospore formation thought to play a role in overwintering lehtinen a , hannukkala a agricultural and food science 13:399–410 variation in such traits also occurs in north america , however importation of new genotypes from mexico appears to be the predominant cause of genetic diversity , as opposed to sexual recombination within potato or tomato fields if adequate field scouting occurs and late blight is found soon after disease development , localized patches of potato plants can be killed with a desiccant ( e.g paraquat ) through the use of a backpack sprayer maincrop varieties which are very slow to develop blight include cara , stirling , teena , torridon , remarka , and romano defender was released in 2004 an example of such took place in the united states during the 2009 growing season a beaumont period is a period of 48 consecutive hours , in at least 46 of which the hourly readings of temperature and relative humidity at a given place have not been less than and 75 % , respectively the smith period has been the preferred system used in the uk since its introduction in the 1970s whilst these methods show potential to allow detection of sporangia in advance of occurrence of detectable disease symptoms on plants , and would thus be useful in enhancing existing decision support systems , none have been commercially deployed to date given the dangers of copper toxicity , other organic control options that have been shown to be effective include horticultural oils , phosphorous acids , and rhamnolipid biosurfactants , while sprays containing '' beneficial '' microbes such as bacillus subtilis or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals ( such as knotweed extract ) have not performed as well it crossed the atlantic ocean with a shipment of seed potatoes for belgian farmers in 1845 since 1941 , eastern africa has been suffering potato production losses because of strains of p '' chemical and biological weapons : possession and programs past and present '' , james martin center for nonproliferation studies , middlebury college , april 9 , 2002 , accessed november 14 , 2008 the disease has been seen in china , india and south-east asian countries
