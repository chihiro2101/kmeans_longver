some indications for anticoagulant therapy that are known to have benefit from therapy include : atrial fibrillation — commonly forms an right atrium clot coronary artery disease deep vein thrombosis — can lead to pulmonary embolism ischemic stroke hypercoagulable states ( e.g the risk of bleeding using the aforementioned risk assessment tools must then be weighed against thrombotic risk in order to formally determine patient 's overall benefit in starting anticoagulation therapy the most serious and common adverse side effect associated with anticoagulant are increased risk of bleeding , both nonmajor and major bleeding events warfarin has an estimated incidence of bleeding of 15-20 % per year and life-threatening bleeding rate of 1-3 % per year bleeding risk is especially important to consider in patients with renal impairment and noac therapy due to the fact that all noacs , to some extent , are excreted by the kidneys purple toe syndrome typically develops three to eight weeks after initiation of warfarin therapy foods and food supplements with blood-thinning effects include nattokinase , lumbrokinase , beer , bilberry , celery , cranberry , fish oil , garlic , ginger , ginkgo , ginseng , green tea , horse chestnut , licorice , niacin , onion , papaya , pomegranate , red clover , soybean , st multivitamins that do not interact with clotting are available for patients on anticoagulants excessive intake of aforementioned food should be avoided whilst taking anticoagulants or , if coagulability is being monitored , their intake should be kept approximately constant so that anticoagulant dosage can be maintained at a level high enough to counteract this effect without fluctuations in coagulability people using anticoagulants to treat this condition should avoid using bed rest as a complementary treatment because there are clinical benefits to continuing to walk and remaining mobile while using anticoagulants in this way since the 2000s a number of agents have been introduced that are collectively referred to as directly acting oral anticoagulants ( doacs ) , novel oral anticoagulants ( noacs ) , or non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants these agents include direct thrombin inhibitor ( dabigatran ) and factor xa inhibitor ( rivaroxaban , apixaban , betrixaban and edoxaban ) and they have been shown to be as good or possibly better than the coumarins with less serious side effects . coumarins ( vitamin k antagonists ) these oral anticoagulants are derived from coumarin , which is found in many plants other examples are acenocoumarol , phenprocoumon , atromentin , and phenindione heparin and derivative substances low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) , is produced through a controlled depolymerization of unfractionated heparin a reversal agent for dabigatran , idarucizumab , is currently available and approved for use by the fda as in any invasive procedures , patients on anticoagulation therapy have increased risk for bleeding and caution should be used along with local hemostasis methods to minimize bleeding risk during the operation as well as post-operatively further clinical prospective studies on doacs are required to investigate the bleeding risk and haemostasis associated to surgical dental procedures many other anticoagulants exist , for use in research and development , diagnostics , or as drug candidates batroxobin , a toxin from a snake venom , clots platelet-rich plasma without affecting platelet functions ( lyses fibrinogen ) however , in urgent settings , or in settings with extremely high inr ( inr > 20 ) , hemostatic reversal agents such as fresh frozen plasma ( ffp ) , recombinant factor viia , and prothrombin complex concentrate ( pcc ) have been utilized with proven efficacy andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified human factor xa decoy that reverses the effect of factor xa inhibitors by binding at the active sites of factor xa inhibitor and making it catalytically inactive in addition , test tubes used for laboratory blood tests will have chemicals added to stop blood clotting apart from heparin , most of these chemicals work by binding calcium ions , preventing the coagulation proteins from using them oxalate has a mechanism similar to that of citrate dental considerations for long-term users , warfarin ) and antiplatelet agents ( e.g , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , or edoxaban ) and undergoing dental treatment ( in conjunction with usual local measures to control bleeding ) , no change to the anticoagulant regimen is required
