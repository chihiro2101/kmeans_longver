more than 1,500 trephined skulls from the neolithic period ( representing 5 to 10 % of all stone age skulls ) have been uncovered throughout the worldfrom europe , siberia , china and the americas , where the subject was living ) has survived later studies documented cases identified from a range of sites in oaxaca and central mexico , such as tilantongo , oaxaca and the major zapotec site of monte albán two specimens from the tlatilco civilization 's homelands ( which flourished around 1400 bce ) indicate the practice has a lengthy tradition a study of ten low-status burials from the late classic period at monte albán concluded that the trepanation had been applied non-therapeutically , and , since multiple techniques had been used and since some people had received more than one trepanation , concluded it had been done experimentally instead , the pre-columbian maya apparently used an abrasive technique that ground away at the back of the skull , thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it , similar to the examples from cholula along with the discovery of these trepanned skulls , another collection of 13 trepanned skulls was discovered and dated to 3,000 years ago additionally , bone regeneration and smooth edges suggest that the subject recovered from the surgery and lived a relatively long time afterward found in a massive burial site , this mummy was one of the hundreds found in the '' little river '' tomb complex out of eight skulls with trepanations from the 6th to 8th centuries found in southwestern germany , seven skulls show clear evidence of healing and survival after trepanation , suggesting that the survival rate of the operations was high and the infection rate was low in the graveyards of pre-christian ( pagan ) magyars , archeologists found a surprisingly high frequency ( 12.5 % ) of skulls with trepanation , although more than 90 % only partial ( these served probably ritual purposes ) the trepanation was performed on adults only , with similar frequencies for males and females , but increasing frequency with age and wealth a small area near ( modern ) rostov-on-don , in southern russia , may have been a centre for ritual trepanning , around 6000 years ago , according to archeologists who discovered remains of eight recipients of the practice , within a small area , all with the incision in the unusual obelion position , high on the back of the head the preoperative imaging allows for accurate examination and evaluation they are smooth to soft tissues and cut only bone in ancient times , trepanation instruments were less complex , and were commonly made out of flint , obsidian , or harder material such as stone knives , and later with metal such as bronze and copper the trepanation surgical procedure includes exposure of the dura mater without damaging the underlying blood vessels , meninges , and brain the location of the trepanation on the skull varies by geographical region and period , common locations are the frontal and the occipital bones the practice of trepanning also continues today due to belief in various pseudoscience medical benefits '' like a hole in the head : the return of trepanation '' february 2 , 2014 , at the wayback machine these claims are unsubstantiated by research at the time the passage below was written , joey and his partner , amanda feilding , had made two previous attempts at trepanning mellen he describes his third attempt at self-trepanation : after some time there was an ominous sounding schlurp and the sound of bubbling
