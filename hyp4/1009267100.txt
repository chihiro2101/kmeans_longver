thumb ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium-sized shrub , growing to all parts of the plant are strongly aromatic there are five stamens surrounding the stigma and style and two fused carpels blackcurrants can grow well on sandy or heavy loams , or forest soils , as long as their nutrient requirements are met although the bushes are winter hardy , frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils this gives the plant a chance to get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit commercially , most harvesting is done mechanically by straddle harvesters the blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time , some machines have conveyor system which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row thumb ribes plants are susceptible to several diseases and a number of insect pests the other host is any of the white pines , in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the north american species that have not co-evolved with the rust the blackcurrant sawfly ( nematus ribesii ) lays its eggs on the underside of the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots , stripping off leaf after leaf in britain the scottish crop research institute was tasked with developing new varieties suitable for growing in the north of the country frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus for gardeners and the pick-your-own market , 'ben sarek ' , 'ben connan ' and 'big ben ' were introduced and have large , sweet berries researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry ( ribes grossularia ) , the red currant ( ribes rubrum ) and the flowering currant ( ribes sanguineum ) back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'titania ' that have a higher yield , better disease resistance , are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting two new releases from a black currant breeding program in british columbia , canada , 'blackcomb ' and 'tahsis ' , were selected for their immunity to white pine blister rust and their frost tolerance during world war ii , most fruits rich in vitamin c , such as oranges , became difficult to obtain in the united kingdom since the american federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century , the fruit remains largely unknown in the united states , and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in europe or new zealand the pur√©e can be used to make blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes , yogurt , ice cream , desserts , sorbets , and many other sweet dishes the exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits , such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding , or apples in crumbles and pies the juice can be used in syrups and cordials they can be added to tomato and mint to make a salad japan imports us 3.6 & nbsp ; million of new zealand blackcurrants for uses as dietary supplements , snacks , functional food products and as quick-frozen ( iqf ) produce for culinary production as jams , jellies or preserves the berries may be infused in a similar manner in britain , 95 % of the blackcurrants grown are used to manufacture ribena ( a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from ribes nigrum ) and similar fruit syrups and juices blackcurrant seed oil is rich in vitamin e and unsaturated fatty acids , including alpha-linolenic acid and gamma-linolenic acid jostaberry redcurrant white currant
