it suppresses inflammation in a similar way to steroids , and is equally as effective as a mid-potency steroid it is applied on the active lesions until they heal off , but may also be used continuously in low doses ( twice a week ) , and applied to the thinner skin over the face and eyelids contraindications and precautions include : breast-feeding hepatic disease immunosuppression infants infection neoplastic disease , such as : skin cancer lung cancer oliguria pregnancy qt interval prolongation sunlight ( uv ) exposure grapefruit juice by mouth or intravenous use the most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments , especially if used over a wide area , include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications , with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas less common are flu-like symptoms , headache , cough , and burning eyes however , current practice by uk dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of these new drugs tacrolimus is a macrolide calcineurin inhibitor calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated t-cells ( nf-at ) , which moves to the nucleus of the t-cell and increases the activity of genes coding for il-2 and related cytokines tacrolimus is predominantly eliminated via the faeces in form of its metabolites the frequency of the g allele varies worldwide , from 4 % in some african populations to 80â€“90 % in caucasian populations however , there is a lack of consistent evidence as to whether dosing based on rs776746 genotype results in improved clinical outcomes ( such as a decreased risk for transplant rejection or drug toxicities ) , likely because patients taking tacrolimus are subject to therapeutic drug monitoring tacrolimus was discovered in 1987 ; it was among the first macrolide immunosuppressants discovered , preceded by the discovery of rapamycin ( sirolimus ) on rapa nui ( easter island ) in 1975 in 2009 , the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric , kidney , liver or heart allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults and children once-daily formulations with marketing authorisation include advagraf ( astellas pharma ) and envarsus ( marketed as envarsus xr in us by veloxis pharmaceuticals and marketed in europe by chiesi ) the synthetic enzymes for tacrolimus are found in 19 gene clusters named fkb as mentioned , if two methoxymalonyl coa molecules are substituted for two malonyl-coa molecules , they will take place in module 7 and 8 ( c13 and c15 ) , and fkba enzyme will enforce this process the process of l -pipecolic acid synthesis is nrps enforced by fkbp enzyme
