sodium carbonate heptahydrate ( not known in mineral form ) , na 2 co 3 ·7h 2 o also known as crystal carbonate in the final step of the solvay process other hydrates have been reported , e.g sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization some common applications of sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) include : sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) is used as a cleansing agent for domestic purposes like washing clothes bottle and window glass ( soda-lime glass ) is made by melting such mixtures of sodium carbonate , calcium carbonate , and silica sand ( silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) ) as sodium carbonate is water-soluble and magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate are insoluble , so it is used to soften water by removing mg 2+ and ca 2+ . food additive and cooking it is also used in the froth flotation process to maintain a favourable ph as a float conditioner besides cao and other mildly basic compounds precursor to other compounds the integral enthalpy of solution of sodium carbonate is −28.1 & nbsp ; kj/mol for a 10 % w/w aqueous solution the mohs hardness of sodium carbonate monohydrate is 1.3 sodium carbonate is soluble in water , and can occur naturally in arid regions , especially in mineral deposits ( evaporites ) formed when seasonal lakes evaporate while there are carbonates on mars , and these are expected to include sodium carbonate , deposits have yet to be confirmed , this absence is explained by some as being due to a global dominance of low ph in previously aqueous martian soil sedimentary geology of mars plant and seaweed sources for soda ash , and also for the related alkali '' potash '' , became increasingly inadequate by the end of the 18th century , and the search for commercially viable routes to synthesizing soda ash from salt and other chemicals intensified clow , archibald and clow , nan l this conversion entails two parts the soda ash is extracted from the black ash with water evaporation of this extract yields solid sodium carbonate in 1861 , the belgium industrial chemist ernest solvay developed a method to make sodium carbonate by first reacting sodium chloride , ammonia , water , and carbon dioxide to generate sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride : : nacl + nh 3 + co 2 + h 2 o → nahco 3 + nh 4 cl the resulting sodium bicarbonate was then converted to sodium carbonate by heating it , releasing water and carbon dioxide : :2nahco 3 → na 2 co 3 + h 2 o + co 2 meanwhile , the ammonia was regenerated from the ammonium chloride byproduct by treating it with the lime ( calcium oxide ) left over from carbon dioxide generation : :2nh 4 cl + cao → 2nh 3 + cacl 2 + h 2 o the solvay process recycles its ammonia
