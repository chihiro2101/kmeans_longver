some languages are designed to support one paradigm ( smalltalk supports object-oriented programming , haskell supports functional programming ) , while other programming languages support multiple paradigms ( such as object pascal , c++ , java , javascript , c , scala , visual basic , common lisp , scheme , perl , php , python , ruby , wolfram language , oz , and f ) yet , avoiding certain techniques can make it easier to understand program behavior , and to prove theorems about program correctness harper , and krishnamurthi floyd , entitled the paradigms of programming , which cites the notion of paradigm as used by thomas kuhn in his the structure of scientific revolutions ( 1962 ) in the 1960s , assembly languages were developed to support library copy and quite sophisticated conditional macro generation and preprocessing abilities , call to ( subroutines ) , external variables and common sections ( globals ) , enabling significant code re-use and isolation from hardware specifics via the use of logical operators such as read/write/get/put these third-generation languages ( the first described as high-level languages ) use vocabulary related to the problem being solved algorithmic language ( algol ) focused on being an appropriate language to define algorithms , while using mathematical language terminology , targeting scientific and engineering problems , just like fortran c a general-purpose programming language , initially developed by dennis ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at at & t bell labs in these languages , data and methods to manipulate it are kept as one unit called an object thus , differing programming paradigms can be seen rather like motivational memes of their advocates , rather than necessarily representing progress from one level to the next in these languages , the computer is told what the problem is , not how to solve the problem the program is structured as a set of properties to find in the expected result , not as a procedure to follow functional programming is a subset of declarative programming most programming languages support more than one programming paradigm to allow programmers to use the most suitable programming style and associated language constructs for a given job .
