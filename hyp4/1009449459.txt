here the superpopulation is '' everybody in the country , given access to this treatment '' – a group which does not yet exist , since the program is n't yet available to all time spent in making the sampled population and population of concern precise is often well spent , because it raises many issues , ambiguities and questions that would otherwise have been overlooked at this stage there is no way to identify all rats in the set of all rats where voting is not compulsory , there is no way to identify which people will vote at a forthcoming election ( in advance of the election ) information about the relationship between sample and population is limited , making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population in addition , nonresponse effects may turn any probability design into a nonprobability design if the characteristics of nonresponse are not well understood , since nonresponse effectively modifies each element 's probability of being sampled within any of the types of frames identified above , a variety of sampling methods can be employed , individually or in combination in some cases , investigators are interested in research questions specific to subgroups of the population simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead 1 ) and ends in an expensive district ( house no a simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end ( or vice versa ) , leading to an unrepresentative sample if periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used , the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population , making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling another drawback of systematic sampling is that even in scenarios where it is more accurate than srs , its theoretical properties make it difficult to quantify that accuracy '' each stratum is then sampled as an independent sub-population , out of which individual elements can be randomly selected ; advantages over other sampling methods focuses on important subpopulations and ignores irrelevant ones improves the accuracy/efficiency of estimation is not useful when there are no homogeneous subgroups can be expensive to implement these data can be used to improve accuracy in sample design the first , fourth , and sixth schools in some cases , an older measurement of the variable of interest can be used as an auxiliary variable when attempting to produce more current estimates clustering can reduce travel and administrative costs in the second stage , a sample of primary units is randomly selected from each cluster ( rather than using all units contained in all selected clusters ) in quota sampling , the population is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups , just as in stratified sampling in quota sampling the selection of the sample is non-random accidental sampling ( sometimes known as grab , convenience or opportunity sampling ) is a type of nonprobability sampling which involves the sample being drawn from that part of the population which is close to hand the voluntary sampling method is a type of non-probability sampling , & fiske , m groves , et alia sampling schemes may be without replacement ( 'wor ' & nbsp ; – no element can be selected more than once in the same sample ) or with replacement ( 'wr ' & nbsp ; – an element may appear multiple times in the one sample ) postulate the effect size of interest , α , and β errors in sample surveys total errors can be classified into sampling errors and non-sampling errors sampling errors and biases non-sampling errors are other errors which can impact final survey estimates , caused by problems in data collection , processing , or sample design such errors may include : over-coverage : inclusion of data from outside of the population under-coverage : sampling frame does not include elements in the population measurement error : e.g when respondents misunderstand a question , or find it difficult to answer processing error : mistakes in data coding participation bias : failure to obtain complete data from all selected individuals after sampling , a review should be held of the exact process followed in sampling , rather than that intended , in order to study any effects that any divergences might have on subsequent analysis thousand oaks , ca : sage publications , & little , r '' survey nonresponse in design , data collection , and analysis '' unit nonresponse ( lack of completion of any part of the survey ) item non-response ( submission or participation in survey but failing to complete one or more components/questions of the survey ) in survey sampling , many of the individuals identified as part of the sample may be unwilling to participate , not have the time to participate ( opportunity cost ) , dillman , d.a , & christian , l internet , mail , and mixed-mode surveys : the tailored design method san francisco : jossey-bass , & zaletel , m '' nonresponse in web surveys '' eltinge , & r ) , survey nonresponse ( pp new york : john wiley & sons for instance , when households have equal selection probabilities but one person is interviewed from within each household , this gives people from large households a smaller chance of being interviewed he also computed probabilistic estimates of the error alexander ivanovich chuprov introduced sample surveys to imperial russia in the 1870s in the us the 1936 literary digest prediction of a republican win in the presidential election went badly awry , due to severe bias more than two million people responded to the study with their names obtained through magazine subscription lists and telephone directories moore and george p '' introduction to the practice of statistics '' .
