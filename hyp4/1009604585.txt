; & garcía-allen , j '' ¿qué es la inteligencia ? del ci a las inteligencias múltiples '' ; aging there is evidence that aging causes a decline in cognitive functions this theory has been confirmed by scientific research in psychology , human intelligence is commonly assessed by iq scores that are determined by iq tests theory of multiple intelligences logical-mathematical intelligence : it implies logical and mathematical abilities spatial intelligence : the ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor ; instead , the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence , and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood a 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence ( gf ) , as measured in several different standard tests , 10 minutes were allowed to complete a normally 45-minute test ) substances which actually or purportedly improve intelligence or other mental functions are called nootropics a meta analysis shows omega 3 fatty acids improves cognitive performance among those with cognitive deficits , but not among healthy subjects neuroethics considers the ethical , legal and social implications of neuroscience , and deals with issues such as the difference between treating a human neurological disease and enhancing the human brain , and how wealth impacts access to neurotechnology regardless of the method used , almost any test that requires examinees to reason and has a wide range of question difficulty will produce intelligence scores that are approximately normal distribution in the general population westport , ct : praeger iq and g ( discussed in the next section ) are correlated with many important social outcomes—individuals with low iqs are more likely to be divorced , have a child out of marriage , be incarcerated , and need long-term welfare support , while individuals with high iqs are associated with more years of education , higher status jobs and higher income , adaptive performance ) , and iq/g is the single best predictor of successful job performance . general intelligence factor or g spearman found that a single common factor explained the positive correlations among tests ( although , an alternative interpretation was recently advanced by van der maas and colleagues definition , operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individual 's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the g factor ( psychometrics ) extracted via factor analysis g is at the top visual processing ( gv ) : is the ability to perceive , analyze , synthesize , and think with visual patterns , including the ability to store and recall visual representations several critics , such as stephen jay gould , have been critical of g , seeing it as a statistical artifact , and that iq tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities robert sternberg is among the researchers who have discussed how one 's culture affects the person 's interpretation of intelligence , and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world to negate this , psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence : successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life , according to one 's own definition of success , within one 's sociocultural context in many eastern cultures , intelligence is mainly related with one 's social roles and responsibilities intelligence and culture , robert serpell , handbook of intelligence , cambridge university press , 2000 , pp
