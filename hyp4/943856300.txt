weisstein , eric w johnson , roger a advanced euclidean geometry , dover publications , 2007 it is normal to distinguish one of the orthocentric points from the others , specifically the one that is the incenter of the orthic triangle ; this one is denoted h as the orthocenter of the outer three orthocentric points that are chosen as a reference triangle abc the orthocentric system and its orthic axes now consider the three other possible triangles , abh , ach , and bch if a point p is chosen on the euler line hn of the reference triangle abc with a position vector p such that p n + α ( h & nbsp ; & minus ; & nbsp ; n ) where α is a pure constant independent of the positioning of the four orthocentric points and three more points p a , p b , p c such that p a n + α ( a & nbsp ; & minus ; & nbsp ; n ) etc , then p , p a , p b , p c form an orthocentric system the locus of the perspectors of this family of rectangular hyperbolas will always lie on the four orthic axes so if a rectangular hyperbola is drawn through four orthocentric points it will have one fixed center on the common nine-point circle but it will have four perspectors one on each of the orthic axes of the four possible triangles the contacts of these inconics with the four possible triangles occur at the vertices of their common orthic triangle the circumcubic known as the orthocubic - k006 is interesting in that it passes through three orthocentric systems as well as the three vertices of the orthic triangle ( but not the orthocenter of the orthic triangle )
