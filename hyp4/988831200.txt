in 1619 kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron the face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells , and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed all primary stellations are fully supported the four kinds of stellation just defined are all subsets of the miller stellations ( 20 are shown in wenninger 's polyhedron models ) seventeen of the nonconvex uniform polyhedra are stellations of archimedean solids miller proposed a set of rules for defining which stellation forms should be considered '' properly significant and distinct '' under miller 's rules we find : there are no stellations of the tetrahedron , because all faces are adjacent there are no stellations of the cube , because non-adjacent faces are parallel and thus can not be extended to meet in new edges there is 1 stellation of the octahedron , the stella octangula there are 3 stellations of the dodecahedron : the small stellated dodecahedron , the great dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron , all of which are kepler–poinsot polyhedra the 59th model in the fifty nine icosahedra is the original icosahedron itself other rules for stellation they are based on combining parts within the stellation diagram in certain ways , and do n't take into account the topology of the resulting faces as such there are some quite reasonable stellations of the icosahedron that are not part of their list – one was identified by james bridge in 1974 , while some '' miller stellations '' are questionable as to whether they should be regarded as stellations at all – one of the icosahedral set comprises several quite disconnected cells floating symmetrically in space wenninger noticed that some polyhedra , such as the cube , do not have any finite stellations the figure comprising these prisms may be called a stellation to infinity from mathematics to art uccello 's depiction was used as the symbol for the venice biennale in 1986 on the topic of '' art and science ''
