'' the destruction of sennacherib '' , by lord byron in other words , the physicality of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem 's effect in '' the destruction of sennacherib '' , each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable , with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line this poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm , and that rhythm has a name : this poem is written in anapestic tetrameter this appearance , though , is deceptive : successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem 's effect on the reading mind 't is a consummation : devoutly to be wished aye , there 's the rub the meter provides a rhythm that informs the line : it is not an invariable formula fourteen lines of iambic pentameter arranged in a more elaborate rhyme scheme form a sonnet : in me thou seest the twilight of such day : as after sunset fadeth in the west , : which by and by black night doth steal away , : death 's second self , which seals up all in rest each quatrain presents a shorter unit of time , creating a sense of time accelerating toward an inevitable end , the death implied in the final couplet at the '' low end '' are forms such as the limerick , which follows a metrical pattern of two lines of anapestic trimeter ( three anapests per line ) , followed by two lines of anapestic dimeter ( two anapests per line ) , followed by one line of anapestic trimeter :

academy , massachusetts ( 17 may 1935 ) , but such is not necessarily the case ( skeptics should try playing tennis without a net ) : success with the open form requires great sensitivity to language and a particular type of adaptable understanding the metre of ‘ classical ’ poetry is replaced in open verse by cadence in rhythm , line indentation , with pauses implied by the syntax , thus the limiting factor of one human breath was naturally incorporated in the poetry , essential to an oral art form , composed to be read aloud just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance , the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words : isolated/detached , launched/fling , tirelessly/ceaselessly , surrounding/surrounded the winding stair is obstructive concealment of meaning the symbolism used in a poem may not always be as overt as metaphor english language poetic meter depends on stress , rather than the number of syllables the most common feet in poetry written in english are the iamb ( weak strong ) , the anapest ( weak weak strong ) , the trochee ( strong weak ) , and the dactyl ( strong weak weak ) sound , tone , diction , and connotation alfred prufrock '' , t eliot quickly sets a certain tone , and then creates effect by juxtaposing it with a very different tone : : let us go then , you and i , : when the evening is spread out against the
