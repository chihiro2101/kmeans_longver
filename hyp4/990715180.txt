examples are resistances , capacitances , inductances , and diodes multiport elementsthese have more than two terminals for example , a transformer with three separate windings has six terminals and could be idealized as a three-port element ; the ends of each winding are connected to a pair of terminals which represent a port they can be used to represent ideal batteries and power supply these are used in the modelling of amplifier components such as transistors , vacuum tubes , and op-amps passive elementsthese are elements which do not have a source of energy , examples are diodes , resistances , capacitances , and inductances another distinction is between linear and nonlinear : linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation , the relation between voltage and current , is a linear function they obey the superposition principle see non-linear elements below relates charge and voltage according to the relation dq c\ , dv four abstract active elements : voltage-controlled voltage source ( vcvs ) generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain ( has infinite input impedance and zero output impedance ) from any two of the circuit variables there are six constitutive relations that can be formed memristance : constitutive relation defined as f ( \phi , q ) 0 in some special cases the constitutive relation simplifies to a function of one variable the fourth passive element , the memristor , was proposed by leon chua in a 1971 paper , but a physical component demonstrating memristance was not created until thirty-seven years later the following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements for example , on a first degree of approximation , a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current ar : عنصر كهربائي
