megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally k-strategists , with high longevity , slow population growth rates , low mortality rates , and ( at least for the largest ) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults starting from just a few kg before the event , maximum size had reached ~50 & nbsp ; kg a few million years later , and ~750 & nbsp ; kg by the end of the paleocene the rate of increase for artiodactyls ( 0.74 ) was about a third that of perissodactyls however , the two parameters are interrelated ( due to sea level drops accompanying increased glaciation ) , making the driver of the trends in maximum size more difficult to identify several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible among toothed whales , maximum body size appears to be limited by food availability the cooling trend in earth 's recent history may have generated more localities of high plankton abundance via wind-driven upwellings , facilitating the evolution of gigantic whales because of the small initial size of all mammals following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs , nonmammalian vertebrates had a roughly ten-million-year-long window of opportunity ( during the paleocene ) for evolution of gigantism without much competition this is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the northern hemisphere , while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on gondwanan land masses and europe however , recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree , and are the sister group of the extinct moa of new zealand predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early cenozoic an analysis of the timing of holarctic megafaunal extinctions and extirpations over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within interstadials , periods of abrupt warming , but only when humans were also present consequences of depletion of megafauna . effect on methane emissions large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of methane , which is an important greenhouse gas modern ruminant herbivores produce methane as a byproduct of foregut fermentation in digestion , and release it through belching or flatulence in the mesozoic , it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually , contributing to the warmer climate of the time ( up to 10 & nbsp ; °c warmer than at present ) the study estimated that the removal of the bison caused a decrease of as much as 2.2 million tons per year this list is not intended to be exhaustive : clade synapsida class mammalia ( phylogenetically , a clade within therapsida ;
