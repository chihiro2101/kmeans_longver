the coil detector was barely sensitive enough , resulting in poor , noisy meg measurements that were difficult to use later , cohen built a much better shielded room at mit , and used one of the first squid detectors , just developed by james e zimmerman , a researcher at ford motor company , to again measure meg signals 250pxthe meg ( and eeg ) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synapse transmission the net currents can be thought of as dipole , i.e appropriate magnetic shielding can be obtained by constructing rooms made of aluminium and mu-metal for reducing high-frequency and low-frequency noise , respectively magnetically shielded room ( msr ) a magnetically shielded room ( msr ) model consists of three nested main layers each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer , similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy insulating washers are used in the screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated an over-determined model may consist of a few point-like sources ( '' equivalent dipoles '' ) , whose locations are then estimated from the data this process is iterated until convergence another common technique is beamforming , wherein a theoretical model of the magnetic field produced by a given current dipole is used as a prior , along with second-order statistics of the data in the form of a covariance matrix , to calculate a linear weighting of the sensor array ( the beamformer ) via the backus–gilbert method if one 's goal is to estimate the current density within the human brain with say a 5mm resolution then it is well established that the vast majority of the information needed to perform a unique inversion must come not from the magnetic field measurement but rather from the constraints applied to the problem a criticism of the use of this technique in clinical practice is that it produces colored areas with definite boundaries superimposed upon an mri scan : the untrained viewer may not realize that the colors do not represent a physiological certainty , because of the relatively low spatial resolution of meg , but rather a probability cloud derived from statistical processes the limitations of dipole models for characterizing neuronal responses are ( 1 ) difficulties in localizing extended sources with ecds , ( 2 ) problems with accurately estimating the total number of dipoles in advance , and ( 3 ) dependency on dipole location , especially depth in the brain independent component analysis ( ica ) is another signal processing solution that separates different signals that are statistically independent in time use in the field neuronal ( meg ) and hemodynamic ( fmri ) data do not necessarily agree , in spite of the tight relationship between local field potentials ( lfp ) and blood oxygenation level-dependent ( bold ) signals there has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia , such as auditory gating deficits to human voices recent studies have reported successful classification of patients with multiple sclerosis , alzheimer 's disease , schizophrenia , sjögren 's syndrome , chronic alcoholism , facial pain and thalamocortical dysrhythmias meg can be used to distinguish these patients from healthy control subjects , suggesting a future role of meg in diagnostics knowing the exact position of essential brain regions ( such as the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex , visual cortex , and areas involved in speech production and comprehension ) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits . comparison with related techniques meg complements other brain activity measurement techniques such as electroencephalography ( eeg ) , positron emission tomography ( pet ) , and fmri meg in comparison to eeg finally , meg is reference-free , while scalp eeg relies on a reference that , when active , makes interpretation of the data difficult .
