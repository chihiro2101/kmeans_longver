points j , k , and l are the midpoints of the line segments between each altitude 's vertex intersection ( points a , b , and c ) and the triangle 's orthocenter ( point s ) in 1822 karl feuerbach discovered that any triangle 's nine-point circle is externally tangent to that triangle 's three excircles and internally tangent to its incircle ; this result is known as feuerbach 's theorem , and lehmann , ingmar let \omega be the nine-point circle of the diagonal triangle of a cyclic quadrilateral this is a consequence of symmetry : the sides of one triangle adjacent to a vertex that is an orthocenter to another triangle are segments from that second triangle furthermore the nine-point circle is the locus of p such that : :pa 2 +pb 2 +pc 2 +ph 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 4r 2 if four arbitrary points a , b , c , d are given that do not form an orthocentric system , then the nine-point circles of abc , bcd , cda and dab concur at a point the remaining six intersection points of these nine-point circles each concur with the midpoints of the four triangles the nine-point circles form a set of four johnson circles the circle is an instance of a conic section and the nine-point circle is an instance of the general nine-point conic that has been constructed with relation to a triangle abc and a fourth point p , where the particular nine-point circle instance arises when p is the orthocenter of abc the vertices of the triangle and p determine a complete quadrilateral and three '' diagonal points '' where opposite sides of the quadrilateral intersect
