more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein these isoprene polymers ( e.g geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate ) are involved in the condensations via enzymes such as prenyltransferase that eventually cyclizes to form cholesterol fatty acylated proteins are proteins that have been post-translationally modified to include the covalent attachment of fatty acids at certain amino acid residues after the protein bh3 interacting-domain death agonist ( bid ) has been myristoylated , it targets the protein to move to the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c , which then ultimately leads to cell death it is believed that this reverse palmitoylation may regulate the interaction of the protein with the membrane and thus have a role in signaling processes when the psd-95 is palmitoylated , it is restricted to the membrane and allows it to bind to and cluster ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane palmitoylation mediates the affinity of a protein for lipid rafts and facilitates the clustering of proteins the phosphatidylinositol group is glycosidically linked to the non-n-acetylated glucosamine of the tetrasaccharide the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane these proteins are only located on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane
