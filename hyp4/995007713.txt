it is neither as secure as the internal network , nor as insecure as the public internet similarly , communication between hosts in the dmz and to the external network is also restricted to make the dmz more secure than the internet and suitable for housing these special purpose services it is also sometimes good practice to configure a separate classified militarized zone ( cmz ) , a highly monitored militarized zone comprising mostly web servers ( and similar servers that interface to the external world i.e the most common of these services are : web servers mail servers ftp servers voip servers web servers that communicate with an internal database require access to a database server , which may not be publicly accessible and may contain sensitive information simplifies recording and monitoring of user activities centralized web content filtering this is an extra layer of security particularly recommended when internal resources need to be accessed from the outside , but it 's worth noting this design still allows remote ( and potentially malicious ) users to talk to the internal resources with the help of the proxy zeltzer , lenny ( april , 2002 ) , ip address ) on the internal network that has all traffic sent to it which is not otherwise forwarded to other lan hosts that is , the dmz host is able to connect to other hosts on the internal network , whereas hosts within a real dmz are prevented from connecting with the internal network by a firewall that separates them unless the firewall permits the connection the dmz host provides none of the security advantages that a subnet provides and is often used as an easy method of forwarding all ports to another firewall / nat device non-standard / no citation template
