a circuit is a non-empty trail with a vertex sequence : let be a directed graph a directed cycle or simple directed circuit is a directed circuit in which the only repeated vertex is the first/last vertex a chordless cycle in a graph , also called a hole or an induced cycle , is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle the most common is the binary cycle space ( usually called simply the cycle space ) , which consists of the edge sets that have even degree at every vertex ; it forms a vector space over the two-element field the existence of a cycle in directed and undirected graphs can be determined by whether depth-first search ( dfs ) finds an edge that points to an ancestor of the current vertex ( it contains a back edge ) distributed cycle detection algorithms are useful for processing large-scale graphs using a distributed graph processing system on a computer cluster ( or supercomputer ) . much research has been published concerning classes of graphs that can be guaranteed to contain hamiltonian cycles ; one example is ore 's theorem that a hamiltonian cycle can always be found in a graph for which every non-adjacent pair of vertices have degrees summing to at least the total number of vertices in the graph graph classes defined by cycles chordal graph , a graph in which every induced cycle is a triangle directed acyclic graph , a directed graph with no cycles line perfect graph , a graph in which every odd cycle is a triangle perfect graph , a graph with no induced cycles or their complements of odd length greater than three pseudoforest , a graph in which each connected component has at most one cycle strangulated graph , a graph in which every peripheral cycle is a triangle strongly connected graph , a directed graph in which every edge is part of a cycle triangle-free graph , a graph without three-vertex cycles
