potentiometric ph meters measure the voltage between two electrodes and display the result converted into the corresponding ph value the electrodes , or probes , are inserted into the solution to be tested the glass electrode for measuring the ph has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration for simplicity , many ph meters use a combination probe , constructed with the glass electrode and the reference electrode contained within a single probe the ph meter is calibrated with solutions of known ph , typically before each use , to ensure accuracy of measurement to measure the ph of a solution , the electrodes are used as probes , which are dipped into the test solutions and held there sufficiently long for the hydrogen ions in the test solution to equilibrate with the ions on the surface of the bulb on the glass electrode however , certain aspects of design are published the silver chloride electrode is most commonly used as a reference electrode in ph meters , although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode with these electrode designs , the voltmeter is detecting potential differences of Â±1400 millivolts probes are generally kept moist when not in use with a medium appropriate for the particular probe , which is typically an aqueous solution available from probe manufacturers more typically calibration is performed once per day of operation the ph meter has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer some versions use telemetry to connect the electrodes to the voltmeter display device additionally , there are commercially available ph meters based on isfet , rather than conventional glass electrodes in october 1934 , arnold orville beckman registered the first patent for a complete chemical instrument for the measurement of ph , u.s 2,058,761 , for his '' acidimeter '' , later renamed the ph meter in years to come , the company sold millions of the units however , commercial suppliers offer voltmeter displays that simplify use , including calibration and temperature compensation
