in february 1937 , there came the new hansa borgward 2000 and in 1939 its name was shortened to borgward 2000 the isabella would become borgward 's most popular model and remained in production for the life of the company peter kurze : borgward typenkunde borgward introduced a line of 1500 & nbsp ; cc sports racers in the 1950s , with the 16-valve engine from these becoming a successful formula two power unit ( which was also used by some f1 privateers in 1961 ) heinrich volker : silberpfeile aus bremen – rennsportwagen der borgward-werke carl borgward died in july 1963 , still insisting the company had been technically solvent it was strongly critical of his business approach , and included many of the arguments later advanced to explain or justify the company 's demise the december 1960 der spiegel article was not the only serious public criticism targeting borgward at this time : suddenly stridently negative ( if more succinct ) comments also turned up in the mass-market bild newspaper and in television reports capital intensive businesses such as auto manufacturing use their expensive machines and tools most efficiently if they use them constantly at full capacity , but the car market in europe in the 1950s/60s was more seasonal than today , with sales diminishing in winter , then peaking in the early summer months : borgward 's inventory of unsold cars at the end of 1960 was higher than usual , reflecting ambitious growth plans , most obviously in respect of the united states market the december 1960 der spiegel article speculated that of the 15,000 borgward cars ordered by the north american dealers in 1960 ( and of the 12,000 delivered to them ) 6,000 might have to be taken back following a slump in north american demand he had studied law at university and worked initially as a lawyer despite his hamburg origins , semler was by this time based in munich , with a network of contacts in the bavarian establishment that probably included fellow csu politician and the future german chancellor , ludwig erhard , who in 1948 had succeeded semler in a top administrative position within the bizone case for a conspiracy those who contend that semler 's role in the borgward bankruptcy was part of a conspiracy orchestrated on behalf of bmw to bring down borgward point out that the “ niche ” allegedly defined by the mid-weight bmws from 1961 bore an uncanny resemblance to the niche previously occupied by the borgward isabella during the 1950s cases against conspiracies are seldom as compelling as cases in support of conspiracies in a period of boom there was little doubt that the affected workers would have found job opportunities with other german automakers , but they would have needed to relocate away from bremen , and the spiegel 's description of carl borgward 's implementation of the redundancies savagely implied a singular absence of human sensitivity at the height of the crisis talks in 1961 carl borgward received ( and robustly rejected ) a 200 million mark offer for his business from chrysler corporation even without his own personal bmw connections , chairman semler might reasonably have concluded that the borgward business as then configured had no realistic prospect of remaining solvent for more than few more months without collapsing into a yet more destructive bankruptcy from which creditors would not recover all their cash , and which could easily end up with the company becoming a third significant foreign transplant to compete on financially unequal terms with the domestically-owned auto industry borgward argentina was founded in 1954 as a joint venture of carl f this model production started in 1960 at the booming of argentina automotive industry development , with a production plan of 500 units for that year borgward ) and karlheinz l the new company later moved to stuttgart borgward b 611 borgward b 622 borgward b 655 borgward b 1000 borgward b 1000z borgward b 1250 borgward b 1500 borgward b 1500f borgward b 2000 borgward b 2500 borgward b 3000 borgward b 4000 borgward b 4500 borgward b 522 borgward b 533 borgward b 544 borgward b 555 302/303a/303b goliath tracked mine list of automobile manufacturers
