the pentium pro ( p6 ) featured many advanced concepts not found in the pentium , although it was n't the first or only x86 processor to implement them ( see nexgen nx586 or cyrix 6x86 ) the pentium pro pipeline had extra decode stages to dynamically translate ia-32 instructions into buffered micro-operation sequences which could then be analysed , reordered , and renamed in order to detect parallelizable operations that may be issued to more than one execution unit at once thus , x86 instructions that operate on the memory ( e.g one of the integer units shares the same ports as the fpu , and therefore the pentium pro can only dispatch one integer micro-op and one floating-point micro-op , or two integer micro-ops per a cycle , in addition to micro-ops for the other three execution units the fpu executes floating-point operations addition and multiplication are pipelined and have a latency of three and five cycles , respectively the pentium pro ( p6 ) introduced new instructions into the intel range ; the cmovxx ( ‘ conditional move ’ ) instructions can move a value that is either the contents of a register or memory location into another register or not , according to some predicate logical condition xx on the flags register , xx being a flags predicate code as given in the condition for conditional jump instructions specific use of partial registers was a common performance optimization in the day , as it incurred no performance penalty on pre-p6 intel processors ; also , the dominant operating systems at the time of the pentium pro 's release were 16-bit dos and the mixed 16/32-bit windows 3.1x and windows 95 ( although the latter requires a 32-bit 80386 cpu , much of its code is still 16-bit for performance reasons , such as user.exe ) gwennap , linley ( 1996-07-08 ) '' digital 's 21164 reaches 500 mhz '' methods to circumvent this included setting vesa drawing to system memory instead of video memory in games such as quake , and later on utilities such as fastvid emerged , which could double performance in certain games by enabling the write combining features of the cpu ( this is an example of mlp , memory level parallelism all versions of the chip were expensive , those with 1024 & nbsp ; kb being particularly so , since it required two 512 & nbsp ; kb cache dies as well as the processor die some users chose to overclock their pentium pro chips , with the 200 & nbsp ; mhz version often being run at 233 & nbsp ; mhz , the 180 & nbsp ; mhz version often being run at 200 & nbsp ; mhz , and the 150 & nbsp ; mhz version often being run at 166 & nbsp ; mhz the chip was popular in symmetric multiprocessing configurations , with dual and quad smp server and workstation setups being commonplace papworth , david b ieee micro , pp instead of two cavities , there is only one , in which the three dies reside , bonded to the package instead of a heat slug the cavities are filled in with epoxy the packaging was designed for socket 8 the intel 440fx chipset explicitly supported both pentium pro and pentium & nbsp ; ii processors , but the intel 440bx and later slot & nbsp ; 1 chipsets did not explicitly support the pentium pro , so the socket & nbsp ; 8 slockets did not see wide use l1 cache : 8 , 8 & nbsp ; kb ( data , instructions ) l2 cache : 256 , 512 & nbsp ; kb ( one die ) or 1024 & nbsp ; kb ( two 512 & nbsp ; kb dies ) in a multi-chip module clocked at cpu-speed socket : socket 8 front side bus : 60 and 66 & nbsp ; mhz vcore : 3.1–3.3 & nbsp ; v fabrication : 0.50 & nbsp ; μm or 0.35 bicmos sandpile.org - ia-32 implementation - intel p6 clockrate : 150 , 166 , 180 , 200 & nbsp ; mhz , ( capable of 233 & nbsp ; mhz on some motherboards ) first release : november 1995 bus and multiprocessor capabilities he was no doubt intimately familiar with all this history list of intel pentium ii microprocessors list of intel pentium pro microprocessors
