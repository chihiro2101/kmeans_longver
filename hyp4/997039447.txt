a dekatron is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode , a glow discharge moves to a step electrode ; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes , a counter system can be developed and the count observed by the position of the glow discharges counter tubes were used widely before development of integrated circuit counter devices cold-cathode lamps include cold-cathode fluorescent lamps ( ccfls ) and neon lamps the collision may just excite the molecule , but sometimes it will knock an electron free to create a positive ion the discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode , enough positive ions hit the cathode to free , on average , another electron it is used in some x-ray tubes , the field-emission microscopy ( fem ) , and field-emission displays ( feds ) cold cathodes sometimes have a rare-earth coating to enhance electron emission some types contain a source of beta radiation to start ionization of the gas that fills the tube a common cold-cathode application is in neon signs and other locations where the ambient temperature is likely to drop well below freezing , the clock tower , palace of westminster ( big ben ) uses cold-cathode lighting behind the clock faces where continual striking and failure to strike in cold weather would be undesirable large cold-cathode fluorescent lamps ( ccfls ) have been produced in the past and are still used today when shaped , long-life linear light sources are required , miniature ccfls were extensively used as backlights for computer and television liquid-crystal displays however , ccfls are strictly limited in the degree to which they can be dimmed , both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode , causing erratic operation , and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps
