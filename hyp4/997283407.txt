the vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture ; where the vector operands were read from , and the resulting vector written to , memory the cpu could be have one , two , or four vector lanes , allowing the cpu to produce one to four vector results every cycle , depending on the number of vector lanes installed keeping eight programs running allowed the system to shuffle execution of programs on the cpu depending on what data was available on the memory bus at that time , minimizing '' dead time '' where the cpu had to wait for data from the memory the pp also included a set of sixty-four 32-bit communications registers ( crs ) when asc machines first became available in the early 1970s , they outperformed almost all other machines , including the cdc star-100 , and under certain conditions matched that of the one-off illiac iv the cray-1 dedicated almost all of its design to sustained high-speed access to memory , including over one million 64-bit words of semiconductor memory and a cycle time that was one-fifth that of the asc ( 12.5 & nbsp ; ns ) asc systems 5 and 6 were installed at ti 's main plant in austin and also used by gsi for seismic data processing asc 7 went to the naval research lab in washington , d.c for plasma physics studies the architecture of pipelined computers & nbsp ; 159 & ndash ; 162
