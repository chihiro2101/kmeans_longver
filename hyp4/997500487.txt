( a variant called an scs—silicon controlled switch—brings all four layers out to terminals ) the operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled bipolar junction transistors , arranged to cause a self-latching action : : thyristors have three states : reverse blocking mode – voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode forward blocking mode – voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct , but the thyristor has not been triggered into conduction forward conducting mode – the thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the '' holding current '' function of the gate terminal if a positive potential v g is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode , the breakdown of the junction j 2 occurs at a lower value of v ak a thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased ( a method known as natural , or line , commutation ) 50 & nbsp ; hz or 60 & nbsp ; hz ) , thyristors with lower values of t q are required such fast thyristors can be made by diffusing heavy metal ions such as gold or platinum which act as charge combination centers into the silicon today , fast thyristors are more usually made by electron or proton irradiation of the silicon , or by ion implantation ) , led by gordon hall and commercialized by g.e the institute of electrical and electronics engineers recognized the invention by placing a plaque at the invention site in clyde , ny and declaring it an ieee historic milestone this is not to be confused with asymmetrical operation , as the output is unidirectional , flowing only from cathode to anode , and so is asymmetrical in nature a thyristor is used in conjunction with a zener diode attached to its gate , and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the zener voltage , the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground ( in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse ) the stabilized high voltage dc supply for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device up and down the falling slope of the positive going half of the ac supply input ( if the rising slope was used the output voltage would always rise towards the peak input voltage when the device was triggered and thus defeat the aim of regulation ) in the realm of this and other very high-power applications , both electrically triggered ( ett ) and light-triggered ( ltt ) thyristors are still the primary choice . comparisons to other devices because of this , use of triacs with ( for example ) heavily inductive motor loads usually requires the use of a '' snubber '' circuit around the triac to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power '' safe firing of thyristors '' on powerguru.org as well as the usual failure modes due to exceeding voltage , current or power ratings , thyristors have their own particular modes of failure , including : turn on di/dt – in which the rate of rise of on-state current after triggering is higher than can be supported by the spreading speed of the active conduction area ( scrs & triacs ) acs acst agt – anode gate thyristor – a thyristor with gate on n-type layer near to the anode ascr – asymmetrical scr bct – bidirectional control thyristor – a bidirectional switching device containing two thyristor structures with separate gate contacts bod – breakover diode – a gateless thyristor triggered by avalanche current diac – bidirectional trigger device dynistor – unidirectional switching device shockley diode – unidirectional trigger and switching device sidac – bidirectional switching device trisil , sidactor – bidirectional protection devices brt – base resistance controlled thyristor eto – emitter turn-off thyristor rashid , muhammad h since no electronic boards need to be provided at the potential of the thyristor in order to trigger it , light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as hvdc
