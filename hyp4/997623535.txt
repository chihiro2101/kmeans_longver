the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the '' combination of an expression vector , its cloned dna , and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell , that is , produce proteins at a high level '' for example , common hosts are bacteria ( such as e.coli , b subtilis ) , yeast ( such as s.cerevisiae ) or eukaryotic cell lines hence , multi-domain eukaryotic proteins expressed in bacteria often are non-functional for example , a dna sequence for a protein of interest could be cloned or subcloned into a high copy-number plasmid containing the lac ( often lacuv5 ) promoter , which is then transformed into the bacterium e fluorescens is a metabolically versatile organism , allowing for high throughput screening and rapid development of complex proteins filamentous fungi , especially aspergillus and trichoderma , but also more recently myceliophthora thermophila c1 have been developed into expression platforms for screening and production of diverse industrial enzymes . non-lytic insect cell expression this is followed by selection and screening of recombinant clones cell lines used for this system include : sf9 , sf21 from spodoptera frugiperda cells , hi-5 from cabbage looper cells , and schneider 2 cells and schneider 3 cells from drosophila melanogaster cells this system gives a homogeneous product leishmania tarentolae ( can not infect mammals ) expression systems allow stable and lasting production of proteins at high yield , in chemically defined media
