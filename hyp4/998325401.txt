the second stage engine ignites shortly before separation of the first stage and the lattice allows the exhaust to escape the first stage of the proton rocket at russian space web a rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972 between 1994 and mid-2010 , proton revenues were 4.3 & nbsp ; billion , and were projected to grow to 6 & nbsp ; billion by 2011 statement by vladimir ye nesterov , khrunichev director-general , at press conference on 15 july 2010 khruhichev 29 july 2010 a number of roscosmos and other russian government missions remain on proton launch manifest it is fuelled by very toxic udmh and nitrogen tetroxide the blok d/dm were unusual in that the fuel was stored in a toroidal tank , around the engine and behind the oxidizer tank when the soviet space station program began in 1971 , protons began being flown with the blok d removed for use as a heavy-lift leo launcher it could place up to in low earth orbit with a 51.6-degree inclination , the orbit of the international space station ( iss ) on 2 july 2013 , a proton-m launching three glonass navigation satellites experienced a failure reminiscent of the 1960s disasters shortly after liftoff when the booster crashed near lc-39 at baikonour , ending a 30-year unbroken stretch without a first stage failure ; all future proton flights were suspended pending investigation debris fell in manchuria the payload mass performance for phase iv has been increased to 6320 & nbsp ; kg to a reference gto orbit with 1500 & nbsp ; m/s of residual delta v to gso however , as kvrb is noticeably larger than block d , the vehicle 's aerodynamics , flight control , software , and possibly electronics would have to be reevaluated they will also be designed from the start to accept a kvtk stage , and will already have a lox supply at the pad ; only a hydrogen supply will be called upon fas – proton launch vehicle ils proton proton launch schedules on satlaunch слабое звено – '' бриз-м ''
