a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo typically , these neurodevelopmental processes can be broadly divided into two classes : activity-independent mechanisms and activity-dependent plasticity activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons developmental neuroscience uses a variety of animal models including the mouse mus musculus , the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster , the zebrafish danio rerio , the frog xenopus laevis , and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the myelin sheath provides insulation for the nerve impulse when communicating between neural systems without it , the impulse would be disrupted and the signal would not reach its target , thus impairing normal functioning during early embryonic development of the vertebrate , the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis and the nervous system ; a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neuroectoderm to form the neural plate which gives rise to the nervous system during neural induction , noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm ( notochord ) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of bmp4 this inhibition of bmp4 causes the cells to differentiate into neural cells in a later stage of development the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain—the mesencephalon , at the mesencephalic flexure or cephalic flexure rostrocaudal ( anteroposterior ) axis the hindbrain , for example , is patterned by hox genes , which are expressed in overlapping domains along the anteroposterior axis under the control of retinoic acid epigenetic modifications include dna methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and dna demethylation dna methylation is catalyzed by dna methyltransferase cajal-retzius cells ( red ) release reelin ( orange ) there are several ways they can do this , e.g by radial migration or tangential migration radial glial cells , whose fibers serve as a scaffolding for migrating cells and a means of radial communication mediated by calcium dynamic activity , act as the main excitatory neuronal stem cell of the cerebral cortex or translocate to the cortical plate and differentiate either into astrocytes or neurons an example of this mode of migration is in gnrh neuron , which make a long journey from their birthplace in the nose , through the forebrain , and into the hypothalamus there is also a method of neuronal migration called multipolar migration they do not resemble the cells migrating by locomotion or somal translocation the neurotrophic hypothesis was formulated by victor hamburger and rita levi montalcini based on studies of the developing nervous system according to the neurotrophic hypothesis , growing axons compete for limiting amounts of target-derived trophic factors and axons that fail to receive sufficient trophic support die by apoptosis trk is a receptor tyrosine kinase gdnf : glial derived neurotrophic factor is a member of the tgfb family of proteins , and is a potent trophic factor for striatal neurons the functional receptor is a heterodimer , composed of type 1 and type 2 receptors activation of the type 1 receptor leads to phosphorylation of smad proteins , which translocate to the nucleus to activate gene expression the transmitter at this synapse is acetylcholine the arrival of the nerve induces clustering of the receptors at the synapse this is an activity-dependent event imaging experiments show that dendrites are highly dynamic during development and often initiate contact with axons neuroligins and syncam as synaptogenic signals : sudhof , serafini , scheiffele and colleagues have shown that neuroligins and syncam can act as factors that induce presynaptic differentiation syncam is a cell adhesion molecule that is present in both pre- and post-synaptic membranes spontaneous activity occurs early during neural circuit development even when sensory input is absent and is observed in many systems such as the developing visual system , auditory system , motor system , hippocampus , cerebellum and neocortex these waves are mediated by neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the initial phase and later on by glutamate pharmacological disruption and mouse models lacking the β2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has shown that the lack of spontaneous activity leads to marked defects in retinotopy and eye-specific segregation in the developing auditory system , developing cochlea generate bursts of activity which spreads across the inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons which relay auditory information to the brain in the auditory system , spontaneous activity is thought to be involved in tonotopic map formation by segregating cochlear neuron axons tuned to high and low frequencies contemporary diffusion-weigthted mri techniques may also uncover the macroscopic process of axonal development if parameter k is decreased one-by-one from k n through k 1 then more and more edges appear in the graph , since the inclusion condition is relaxed
