these components consisted of information analysis , collaboration , decision-support tools , language translation , data-searching , pattern recognition , and privacy-protection technologies inscom was to house tia 's hardware in fort belvoir , virginia universities enlisted to assist with research and development included berkeley , colorado state , carnegie mellon , columbia , cornell , dallas , georgiatech , maryland , mit , and southampton to that end , tia was to create a counter-terrorism information system that : increases information coverage by an order of magnitude and affords easy scaling provides focused warnings within an hour after a triggering event occurs or an evidence threshold is passed automatically queues analysts based on partial pattern matches and has patterns that cover 90 % of all previously known foreign terrorist attacks supports collaboration , analytical reasoning and information sharing so that analysts can hypothesize , test and propose theories and mitigating strategies , so decision-makers can effectively evaluate the impact of policies and courses of action unlike the other program components , genoa predated tia and provided a basis for it '' effective analysis across heterogenous databases '' means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of data—such as a database containing criminal records , a phone call database and a foreign intelligence database scalable social network analysis evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) communicator was to be wireless , mobile , and to function in a networked environment fuse face and gait recognition into a 24/7 human identification system develop and demonstrate a human identification system that operates out to 150 meters ( 500 & nbsp ; ft ) using visible imagery the video sequences of body motion data consisted of six separate viewpoints of 25 subjects walking on a treadmill the university of southampton 's department of electronics and computer science was developing an '' automatic gait recognition '' system and was in charge of compiling a database to test it tia 's genisys component , in addition to integrating and organizing separate databases , was to run an internal '' privacy protection program citizens , enforce privacy laws and policies , and report misuse of data there were also plans for tia to have an application that could '' anonymize '' data , so that information could be linked to an individual only by court order ( especially for medical records gathered by the bio-surveillance project ) the term '' total information awareness '' was first coined at the 1999 annual darpatech conference in a presentation by the deputy director of the office of information systems management , brian sharkey in january 2002 poindexter was appointed director of the newly created information awareness office division of darpa , which managed tia 's development soon project genoa was completed and its research moved on to genoa ii late that year , the information awareness office awarded the science applications international corporation ( saic ) a 19 million contract to develop the '' information awareness prototype system '' , the core architecture to integrate all of tia 's information extraction , analysis , and dissemination tools groove made it possible for analysts from many different agencies to share intelligence data instantly , and linked specialized programs that were designed to look for patterns of suspicious behavior . congressional restrictions and termination 108-7 , division m , § 111 ( b ) passed in february , the defense department was given 90 days to compile a report laying out a schedule of tia 's development and the intended use of allotted funds or face a cutoff of support at some point in early 2003 , the national security agency began installing access nodes on tia 's classified network still , in 2013 former director of national intelligence james clapper lied about a massive data collection on us citizens and others edward snowden said that because of clapper 's lie he lost hope to change things formally
