the structure of the catalyst is uncertain selectivity decreases with larger r 1 , but increases with larger r 2 and r 3 ( see introduction ) substrates which were locked in the pseudo equatorial position were shown to undergo oxidation to form the ene-one in both cases of vanadium catalyzed epoxidations , the epoxidzed product showed excellent selectivity for the diastereomer the second is the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen , which draws electron density away from the alkene , lowering its reactivity science , 1986 , 231 , 1108-1117 accounts of chemical research , 1999 , 32.8 , 703-710 in systems that hydrogen bond , a 1,3 strain plays a larger role because the required geometry forces any allylic substituents to have severe a 1,3 interactions , but avoids a 1,2 a transition state proposed by mihelich shows that for these reactions , the driving force for selectivity is minimizing a 1,3 strain in a pseudo chair structure although it is the least reactive metal catalyst for epoxidations , vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols early work done by sharpless shows its preference for reacting with alkenes with allylic alcohols over more substituted electron dense alkenes asymmetric catalytic oxidation juliá–colonna epoxidation
