in mathematics in 1954 and an m.s his interest in studying elementary chemical processes in molecular-beam reactive collisions challenged an often-accepted belief that '' collisions do not occur in crossed molecular beams '' in 1963 , herschbach returned to harvard university as a professor of chemistry in 1967 , yuan t lee joined the lab as a postdoctoral student , and herschbach , lee , and graduate students doug macdonald and pierre lebreton began to construct a '' supermachine '' for studying collisions such as cl + br 2 and hydrogen and halogen reactions his most acclaimed work , for which he won the nobel prize in chemistry in 1986 with yuan t lee and john c in october 2010 , herschbach participated in the usa science and engineering festival 's lunch with a laureate program where middle and high school students will get to engage in an informal conversation with a nobel prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch although still an active research professor at harvard , he joined the texas a & m university faculty september 1 , 2005 as a professor of physics , teaching one semester per year in the chemical physics program herschbach 's wife , georgene herschbach , served as the associate dean of harvard college for undergraduate academic programs these include the national medal of science , the acs award in pure chemistry , the linus pauling medal , the irving langmuir award , the golden plate award of the academy of achievement , and the american institute of chemists gold medal '' the determination of molecular structure from rotational spectra '' , stanford university , university of california , lawrence radiation laboratory , berkeley , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) ( july 1962 ) zare , r
