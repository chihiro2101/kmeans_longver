these letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by isidorus of miletus , the architect of the hagia sophia patriarchal church , sometime around 530 ad in the then byzantine greek capital city of constantinople before that it was not widely known among mathematicians , physicists or historians in addition , after disappearing from the greek orthodox patriarchate 's library , a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value , further damaging the text the ownership of the palimpsest was immediately contested in federal court in new york in the case of the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem v judge kimba wood decided in favor of christie 's auction house on laches grounds , and the palimpsest was bought for 2 million by an anonymous american buyer this was directed by dr abigail quandt performing the conservation of the manuscript from the rochester institute of technology , dr christens-barry from equipoise imaging , and dr the team digitally processed these images to reveal more of the underlying text with pseudocolor reviel netz , william noel and nigel wilson the archimedes palimpsest , vol the production of x-ray fluorescence was described by keith hodgson , director of ssrl : '' synchrotron light is created when electrons traveling near the speed of light take a curved path around a storage ring—emitting electromagnetic light in x-ray through infrared wavelengths '' in april 2007 , it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest , which was a commentary on aristotle 's categories running to some 9 & nbsp ; 000 words it is from his speech against diondas , and was published in 2008 in the german scholarly magazine zeitschrift für papyrologie und epigraphik , vol on october 29 , 2008 , ( the tenth anniversary of the purchase of the palimpsest at auction ) all data , including images and transcriptions , were hosted on the digital palimpsest web page for free use under a creative commons license , the digital archimedes palimpsest released , dot porter , the stoa consortium , october 29 , 2008 in late 2011 , it was the subject of the walters art museum exhibit '' lost and found : the secrets of archimedes '' the method of mechanical theorems since the greeks were aware that some numbers were irrational , their notion of a real number was a quantity q approximated by two sequences , one providing an upper bound and the other a lower bound among those problems were that of calculating the center of gravity of a solid sphere , the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid , and the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines but there are two essential differences between archimedes ' method and 19th-century methods : archimedes did not know about differentiation , so he could not calculate any integrals other than those that came from center-of-mass considerations , by symmetry image : stomachion.jpg thumb ostomachion is a dissection puzzle in the archimedes palimpsest ( shown after suter from a different source ; this version must be stretched to twice the width to conform to the palimpsest ) in heiberg 's time , much attention was paid to archimedes ' brilliant use of indivisibles to solve problems about areas , volumes , and centers of gravity reviel netz of stanford university has argued that archimedes discussed the number of ways to solve the puzzle , that is , to put the pieces back into their box modern combinatorics reveals that the number of ways to place the pieces of the suter board to reform their square , allowing them to be turned over , is 17,152 ; the number is considerably smaller – 64 – if pieces are not allowed to be turned over
