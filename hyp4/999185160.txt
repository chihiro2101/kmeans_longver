it is a joint project of these members : the italian astronomical community represented by the istituto nazionale di astrofisica , the university of arizona , university of minnesota , university of notre dame , university of virginia , the lbt beteiligungsgesellschaft in germany ( max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , landessternwarte in heidelberg , leibniz institute for astrophysics potsdam ( aip ) , max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in munich and max planck institute for radio astronomy in bonn ) ; the ohio state university ; and the research corporation for science advancement based in tucson , az the cost was around 100 million euro lbt takes advantage of active and adaptive optics , provided by arcetri observatory also , an interferometry mode will be available , with a maximum baseline of for aperture synthesis imaging observations and a baseline of for nulling interferometry the telescope was designed by a group of italian firms , and assembled by ansaldo in its milanese plant the choice of location sparked considerable local controversy , both from the san carlos apache tribe , who view the mountain as sacred , and from environmentalists who contended that the observatory would cause the demise of an endangered subspecies of the american red squirrel , the mount graham red squirrel the telescope was dedicated in october 2004 and saw first light with a single primary mirror on october 12 , 2005 which viewed ngc 891 the third image was a composite of ultraviolet , green and deep red light and shows the detailed structure of hot , moderate and cool stars in the galaxy ( mods1 operational – mods2 in integration on the mountain ) luci – two multi-object and longslit infrared spectrographs plus imagers , one for each side ( associated with one of the 8m mirrors ) of the telescope end of commissioning and hand over to the lbto was in 2018 ( in commissioning phase – first stabilization of the fringes in dec 2013 ) flao – first light adaptive optics to correct atmospheric distortion argos – multiple laser guide star unit capable of supporting ground layer or multi conjugate adaptive optics
