in fact the ducted-fan engine backfired , setting the aircraft on fire before any flights were ever made , and it lacked nearly all of the features necessary for a jet engine - including a lack of fuel injection , and any concern about hot jet efflux being directed at a highly flammable fabric surface retrieved : 26 september 2011 the first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention was the italian caproni campini n.1 motorjet prototype that flew on august 27 , 1940 the meteor was the first production jet , with the first orders for production examples being made on 8 august 1941 , butler , 2006 , p.8 the prototype first flying on 5 march 1943 and the first production airframe flying on 12 january 1944 , butler , 2006 , p.23 while the first orders for production me 262 aircraft were not issued until 25 may 1943 , radinger , 1996 , p.33 and the first production me 262 did not fly until 28 march 1944 radinger , 1996 , p.49 despite the me 262 program having started earlier than that of the meteor , as projekt 1065 , with initial plans drawn up by dr waldemar voigt 's design team in april 1939 the us introduced the north american b-45 tornado , their first jet bomber , into service in 1948 the fastest military jet aircraft was the sr-71 blackbird at mach 3.35 cruise missiles are single-use unmanned jet aircraft , powered predominately by ramjets or turbojets or sometimes turbofans , but they will often have a rocket propulsion system for initial propulsion the hiller yh-32 hornet and fairey ultra-light helicopter were among the many helicopters where the rotors were driven by tip jets aerodynamics is therefore an important consideration turbojets are the second oldest type ; it has a high , usually supersonic , exhaust speed and low frontal cross-section , and so is best suited to high-speed , usually supersonic , flight one difference is that jet engines respond relatively slowly this complicates takeoff and landing maneuvers in aircraft overall propulsive efficiency \eta is the efficiency , in percent , with which the energy contained in a vehicle 's propellant is converted into useful energy , to replace losses due to air drag , gravity , and acceleration the exact formula for air-breathing engines as given in the literature , k.honicke , r.lindner , p.anders , m.krahl , h.hadrich , k.rohricht beschreibung der konstruktion der triebwerksanlagen interflug , berlin , 1968 spittle , peter '' gas turbine technology '' p507 , rolls-royce plc , 2003 lutz warsitz : the first jet pilot â€“ the story of german test pilot erich warsitz , pen and sword books ltd , england , 2009 , , english edition
