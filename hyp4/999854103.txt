an automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston ( see below ) , horst bauer ( ed ) , automotive handbook 4th edition , robert bosch gmbh , 1996 , , page 584 one design consideration , when designing or choosing a shock absorber , is where that energy will go effective wheel bounce damping may require tuning shocks to an optimal resistance spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs , though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well in common with carriages and railway locomotives , most early motor vehicles used leaf springs it also operated in both directions these friction disk shock absorbers were also fitted to many cars '' what a chauffeur expects to see at olympia '' , the automotor journal , nov 9th 1912 , p1313 this layout was presumably selected as it was easy to apply to existing vehicles , but it meant the hydraulic damping was not applied to the action of the main leaf spring , but only to the action of the auxiliary spring in the unit itself also known as a '' two-tube '' shock absorber , this device consists of two nested cylindrical tubes , an inner tube that is called the '' working tube '' or the '' pressure tube '' , and an outer tube called the '' reserve tube '' variously known as a '' gas cell two-tube '' or similarly-named design , this variation represented a significant advancement over the basic twin-tube form these pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston , and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness the mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes , making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks or so ) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle 's weight , something which no other shock absorber is designed to do mercedes became the first auto manufacturer to install mono-tube shocks as standard equipment on some of their cars starting in 1958 shelton , p.24 and p.26 caption spool valving can be applied with monotube , twin-tube , and/or position-sensitive packaging , and is compatible with electronic control : solid state , tapered chain shock absorbers , using one or more tapered , axial alignment ( s ) of granular spheres , typically made of metals such as nitinol , in a casing '' dampers : smoothing out the bumps '' , in northey , tom , ed world of automobiles ( london : orbis , 1974 ) , volume 5 , p.490 one advantage of this type is , by using special internal valving , the absorber may be made relatively soft to compression ( allowing a soft response to a bump ) and relatively stiff to extension , controlling '' rebound '' , which is the vehicle response to energy stored in the springs ; similarly , a series of valves controlled by springs can change the degree of stiffness according to the velocity of the impact or rebound in very heavy duty units used for racing or off-road use , there may even be a secondary cylinder connected to the shock absorber to act as a reservoir for the oil and pressurized gas shock absorber vs struts
