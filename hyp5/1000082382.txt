for light aircraft , usually full power is used during takeoff the term rotation is used because the aircraft pivots around the axis of its main landing gear while still on the ground , usually because of gentle manipulation of the flight controls to make or facilitate this change in aircraft attitude ( once proper air displacement occurs under / over the wings , an aircraft will lift off on its own ; controls are to ease that in ) retrieved 12 august 2015 some aircraft are specifically designed for short takeoff and landing , which they achieve by becoming airborne at very low speeds the v r for transport category aircraft is calculated such as to allow the aircraft to reach the regulatory screen height at v 2 with one engine failed the reason it might be needed is due to the aircraft 's weight exceeding the normal maximum takeoff weight , insufficient power , or the available runway length may be insufficient , or a hot and high airfield , or a combination of all four factors other late third reich projects , such as the heinkel p.1077 julia or the focke-wulf volksj√§ger , climbed to their ceiling at a nearly vertical angle and landed later on a skid ulrich albrecht : artefakte des fanatismus ; technik und nationalsozialistische ideologie in der endphase des dritten reiches ( in german ) vertical take-off and landing ( vtol ) aircraft include fixed-wing aircraft that can hover , take off and land vertically as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors , such as tiltrotors '' vertical takeoff & landing aircraft , '' john p '' annals of the new york academy of sciences , vol 107 , art.1 , 25 march 1963
