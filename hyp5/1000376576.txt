pyrrole has a nutty odor pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the n–h position , with a pk a of 16.5 & nbsp ; f runge in 1834 , as a constituent of coal tar in 1857 , it was isolated from the pyrolysate of bone the knorr pyrrole synthesis involves the reaction of an α-amino ketone or an α-amino-β-ketoester with an activated methylene compound the starting materials in the piloty–robinson pyrrole synthesis , named for gertrude and robert robinson and oskar piloty , are two equivalents of an aldehyde and hydrazine in the second step , a 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangement takes place between the mechanism was developed by the robinsons this can then either spontaneously cyclize to form 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid , which is reduced to proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase ( using nadh or nadph ) , or turned into ornithine by ornithine aminotransferase , followed by cyclisation by ornithine cyclodeaminase to form proline this intermediate is then modified by methylation ( which incorporates a methyl group from l-methionine onto the alcohol at the 6 position ) and oxidation of the primary alcohol to the aldehyde to yield the core a-b ring structures under acidic conditions , pyrroles polymerize easily , and thus many electrophile reagents that are used in benzene chemistry are not applicable to pyrroles in contrast , substituted pyrroles ( including protected pyrroles ) have been used in a broad range of transformations . reaction of pyrrole with electrophiles pyrroles generally react with electrophiles at the α position ( c2 or c5 ) , due to the highest degree of stability of the protonated intermediate 2-acylpyrroles are also obtained from reaction with nitriles , by the houben–hoesch reaction alkylation to form enones at c2 has been seen pyrroles with n-substitution can undergo cycloaddition reactions such as 4+2- , 2+2- , and 2+1-cyclizations with dichlorocarbene , a dichlorocyclopropane intermediate is formed , which breaks down to form 3-chloropyridine ( the ciamician–dennstedt rearrangement ) polypyrrole is of some commercial value simple aromatic rings tetrapyrrole polypyrrole azonine
