the three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord , and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament after reentering the pelvis , it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa , being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal , along with the internal pudendal blood vessels inside the pudendal canal , the nerve divides into branches , first giving off the inferior rectal nerve , then the perineal nerve , before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis ( in males ) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ( in females ) sometimes dorsal rami of the first sacral nerve contribute fibers to the pudendal nerve , and even more rarely this means that during periods of increased acetylcholine release the skeletal muscle in the external urethral sphincter contracts , causing urinary retention prolonged or difficult childbirth ) or chronically ( e.g chronic straining during defecation caused by constipation ) , the pudendal nerve is vulnerable to stretch-induced neuropathy a pelvic tumor ( most notably a large sacrococcygeal teratoma ) , or surgery to remove the tumor , can also cause permanent damage the pudendal nerve is difficult to visualize on routine ct or mri , however under ct guidance , a needle may be placed adjacent to the pudendal neurovascular bundle alcock documented the existence of the canal and pudendal nerve in a contribution about iliac arteries in robert bentley todd 's '' the cyclopaedia of anatomy and physiology ''
