the central idea of this program was that if we could give finitary proofs of consistency for all the sophisticated formal theories needed by mathematicians , then we could ground these theories by means of a metamathematical argument , which shows that all of their purely universal assertions ( more technically their provable arithmetical hierarchy ) are finitarily true ; once so grounded we do not care about the non-finitary meaning of their existential theorems , regarding these as pseudo-meaningful stipulations of the existence of ideal entities barkley rosser 's refinement , weakening the above requirement of ω-consistency to simple consistency ; axiomatisation of the core of gödel 's result in terms of a modal language , provability logic ; transfinite iteration of theories , due to alan turing and solomon feferman ; the discovery of self-verifying theories , systems strong enough to talk about themselves , but too weak to carry out the diagonal lemma that is the key to gödel 's unprovability argument the three most well-known styles of proof calculi are : the hilbert system the natural deduction calculi the sequent calculi each of these can give a complete and axiomatic formalization of propositional or predicate logic of either the classical or intuitionistic flavour , almost any modal logic , and many substructural logics , such as relevance logic or linear logic gentzen 's natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof , as shown by dag prawitz gödel 's second incompleteness theorem implies that the well-foundedness of such an ordinal can not be proved in the theory t consequences of ordinal analysis include ( 1 ) consistency of subsystems of classical second order arithmetic and set theory relative to constructive theories , ( 2 ) combinatorial independence results , and ( 3 ) classifications of provably total recursive functions and provably well-founded ordinals there are also modal analogues of the fixed-point theorem simpson 2010 the field was founded by harvey friedman the goal of reverse mathematics , however , is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory in reverse mathematics , one starts with a framework language and a base theory—a core axiom system—that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in , but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems that is , one provides a constructive mapping that translates the theorems of c to the theorems of i this interpretation is commonly known as the dialectica interpretation formal and informal proof intermediate logic model theory proof ( truth ) proof techniques carnegie-mellon technical report cmu-phil-120 handbook of mathematical logic basic proof theory , cambridge tracts in theoretical computer science , cambridge university press , collected papers of gerhard gentzen translated by szabo from '' untersuchungen über das logische schliessen '' , mathematisches zeitschrift v popular lectures on mathematical logic , van nostrand ( publisher ) , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy .
