according to research by dembe and boden , dembe , allard e and boden , leslie i 257–79 the term dates back to the 17th century and was widely used by english insurance companies by the late 19th century rowell and connelly offer a detailed description of the genesis of the term moral hazard , d rowell , lb connelly ( 2012 ) “ a history of the term “ moral hazard ” ” journal of risk and insurance 79 ( 4 ) , 1051–75 by identifying salient changes in economic thought , which are identified within the medieval theological and probability literature in 1998 , william j gao/ggd-00-67r questions concerning ltcm and our responses general accounting office , february 23 , 2000 tyler cowen concludes that '' creditors came to believe that their loans to unsound financial institutions would be made good by the fed — as long as the collapse of those institutions would threaten the global credit system in one kind of mortgage securitization , known as '' agency securitizations , '' default risk is retained by the securitizing agency that buys the mortgages from originators the securitizing entity , therefore , has relatively little incentive to monitor originators and maintain loan quality taxpayers were n't on the hook if they went belly up pre-crisis , only their shareholders and other creditors were it has been suggested that this may have caused the subprime mortgage crisis lenders , who sold mortgages soon after underwriting them , pushed risk onto investors others believe that financial bailouts of lending institutions do not encourage risky lending behavior since there is no guarantee to lending institutions that a bailout will occur because these institutions did n't expect to hold on to the loans until maturity , they could pass on the risk to the buyer of the loans therefore , mortgage loan originators may have been in a situation of moral hazard , because they did n't bear the costs of the risky mortgages they were underwriting '' too big to fail '' banks may have believed they were essentially invincible to failure , thus putting them in a position of moral hazard : they could take on big risks - thus increasing their expected payoff - thinking that the federal government would bail them out in the event of a major failure the name comes originally from the insurance industry if insurance companies could perfectly observe the actions of their clients , they could deny coverage to clients choosing risky actions ( like smoking in bed or not wearing seat belts ) , allowing them to provide thorough protection against risk ( fire or accidents ) without encouraging risky behavior however , since insurance companies can not perfectly observe their clients ' actions , they are discouraged from providing the amount of protection that would be provided in a world with perfect information it also arises in banking and finance : if a financial institution knows it is protected by a lender of last resort , it may make riskier investments than it would in the absence of the protection in insurance markets , moral hazard occurs when the behavior of the insured party changes in a way that raises costs for the insurer since the insured party no longer bears the full costs of that behavior assume this health insurance makes health care free for the individual in this case , the individual will have a price of 0 for the health care and thus will consume 20 units in economic theory , moral hazard is a situation in which the behavior of one party may change to the detriment of another after the transaction has taken place green ( 1995 ) , microeconomic theory the individual taking greater risks during the period would be ex-ante moral hazard whereas lying about a fictitious health problem to defraud the insurance company would be ex post moral hazard according to hart and holmström ( 1987 ) , moral hazard models can be subdivided in models with hidden action and models with hidden information since there is no data on unobservable variables , the contract-theoretic moral hazard model is difficult to test directly , but there have been some successful indirect tests with field data
