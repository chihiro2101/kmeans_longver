a layer of riverine sediments , radiocarbon dated to ca 45 , by richard olson , publisher university of california press cicero , reacting to the chronologies of such authors as berossos ( who composed a greek-language history of babylonia , known as the babyloniaca , during the 3rd century bc ) strongly criticised the claim that the babylonians had kings going back hundreds of thousands of years : diodorus siculus also wrote something similar about how he believed the babylonians fabricated their chronology : despite these criticisms , some ancient greeks , including most notably alexander polyhistor and proclus , believed the babylonian kings were hundreds of thousands of years old , and that the babylonians dated their creation 400,000–200,000 years before their own time proclus , in timaeum , i manetho , ( trans waddell ) , william heinemann , london , 1940 , introduction pp xvi-xvii eusebius , regarding aegyptiaca , in his chronicle recorded that : david freidel , linda schele , and joy parker , maya cosmos : three thousand years on the shaman 's path ( new york : william morrow , 1993 ) pp.59–75 if these events and ages are interpreted literally throughout and the genealogies are considered closed , it is possible to build up a chronology in which many of the events of the old testament are dated to an estimated number of years after creation these were calculated from the genealogies in two versions of the bible , with most of the difference arising from two versions of genesis the older dates stem from the greek septuagint catholic encyclopedia : biblical chronology james ussher agrees with the dating until the birth of abraham , which he argues took place when terah was 130 , and not 70 as is the direct reading of , thus adding 60 years to his chronology for events postdating abraham many of the earliest christians who used the septuagint version of the bible calculated creation as having occurred about 5500 bc , and christians up to the middle-ages continued to use this rough estimate : clement of alexandria ( 5592 bc ) , theophilus of antioch ( 5529 bc ) , sextus julius africanus ( 5501 bc ) , hippolytus of rome ( 5500 bc ) , gregory of tours ( 5500 bc ) , panodorus of alexandria ( 5493 bc ) , maximus the confessor ( 5493 bc ) , george syncellus ( 5492 bc ) , sulpicius severus ( 5469 bc ) and isidore of seville ( 5336 bc ) among the masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation only archbishop ussher 's specific chronology dating the creation to 4004 bc became the most accepted and popular , mainly because this specific date was attached to the king james bible in 1738 , said he had collected over 200 different estimates , ranging from 3483 bc to 6984 bc
