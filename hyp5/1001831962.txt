in 1974 , pathologist stanley cohen , m.d cytokines have been classed as lymphokines , interleukins , and chemokines , based on their presumed function , cell of secretion , or target of action this is the largest family the il-1 family , which primarily includes il-1 and il-18 a key focus of interest has been that cytokines in one of these two sub-sets tend to inhibit the effects of those in the other there are both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that regulate this pathway in recent years , the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves , partly because of their remarkable characteristics and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states immunoglobulin superfamily , which are ubiquitously present throughout several cells and tissues of the vertebrate body , and share structural homology with immunoglobulins ( antibody ) , cell adhesion molecules , and even some cytokines examples : il-1 receptor types tumor necrosis factors ( tnf ) ( type 3 ) family , whose members share a cysteine-rich common extracellular binding domain , and includes several other non-cytokine ligands like cd40 , cd27 and cd30 , besides the ligands on which the family is named interleukin-17 receptor ( il-17r ) family , which shows little homology with any other cytokine receptor family the known members of this family are as follows : il-17ra , il-17rb , il-17rc , il17rd and il-17re andrews ' diseases of the skin : clinical dermatology . roles in health and disease the expression of these transcripts indicates that preimplantation embryos may be responsive to lif originating either from the surrounding environment or from the embryos themselves and exerting its function in a paracrine or autocrine manner current data suggest cytokine storms may be the source of extensive lung tissue damage and dysfunctional coagulation in covid-19 infections . medical use as drugs interferon gamma is used to treat chronic granulomatous disease and osteopetrosis
