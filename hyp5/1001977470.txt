thick layers of sediment and carbonate rock were deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged when seas receded , terrestrial sedimentary deposits and erosion dominated during the middle ordovician period ( about 458-470 million years ago ) , a change in plate motions set the stage for the first paleozoic mountain building event ( taconic orogeny ) in north america . mesozoic era and later the appalachian basin is a foreland basin containing paleozoic sedimentary rocks of early cambrian through early permian age . coal , oil , and gas production currently , the coal primarily is used within the eastern u.s a second major trend of oil and gas production in the appalachian basin began with the discovery in 1885 of oil and gas in lower silurian clinton sandstone reservoirs in knox county , ohio the blue ridge thrust belt province underlies parts of eight states from central alabama to southern pennsylvania along its western margin , the blue ridge is thrust over the folded and faulted margin of the appalachian basin , so that a broad segment of paleozoic strata extends eastward for tens of miles , buried beneath these subhorizontal crystalline thrust sheets surface rocks consist mainly of a core of moderate-to high-rank crystalline metamorphic or igneous rocks , which , because of their superior resistance to weathering and erosion , commonly rise above the adjacent areas of low-grade metamorphic and sedimentary rock the province is bounded on the north and west by the paleozoic strata of the appalachian basin province and on the south by cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the gulf coastal plain
