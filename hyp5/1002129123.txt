microsoft and apple , who were very competitive at the time , were unable to agree on common goals and did not work together at about the same time , a group of third-party developers had met at the apple worldwide developers conference ( wwdc '91 ) and tried to establish a standardized document format , based conceptually on the electronic arts interchange file format ( iff ) with opendoc entering the historic aim alliance between apple , ibm , and motorola , apple was also involved in taligent during some of this period , which promised somewhat similar functionality although based on very different underlying mechanisms in 1993 , john sculley called project amber ( a codename for what would become opendoc ) a path toward taligent therefore , reception was very mixed the opendoc subsystem was initially released on system 7.5 , and later on os/2 warp 4 the wav word processor is a semi-successful opendoc word processor from digital harbor llc lexi from soft-linc , inc bare bones software tested the market by making its bbedit lite freeware text editor available as an opendoc editor component another opendoc container application , called dock'em , was written by metamind software under a grant from the national science foundation and commissioned by the center for research in math and science education , headquartered at san diego state university physics curricula for high school and middle school used them as their focus components of the e-slate educational microworlds platform were originally implemented as opendoc parts in c++ on both macos and windows , reimplemented later ( after the discontinuation of opendoc ) as java applets and eventually as javabeans another issue was that opendoc had little in common with most '' real world '' document formats , and so opendoc documents could really only be used by other opendoc machines for instance , it took significant effort for the system to be able to turn a text file with some pictures into a microsoft word document , both because the text editor had no idea what was in the embedded objects , and because the proprietary microsoft format was undocumented and required reverse engineering in order to obtain a windows 95 compliance logo from microsoft , one had to meet certain interoperability tests which were quite difficult to meet without adoption of ole technology , even though the technology was largely only useful in integrating with microsoft office apple was rapidly losing money at the time and many in the industry press expected the company to fail
