; muscle pain muscle pain from madd is not well understood , but is partially due to high levels of lactate the over exertion can cause mild to severe cases of rhabdomyolysis , which is painful adenosine mediates pain through adenosine receptors ; muscle weakness muscle weakness is not a major symptom , though the progressive effects of chronic muscle damage from rhabdomyolysis will eventually cause significant weakness anesthesia has the potential to cause malignant hyperthermia , an uncontrolled increase in body temperature , and permanent muscle damage in patients with madd individuals with madd are advised to notify their anesthesiologist about their condition prior to surgery in most cases where myopathy is present with madd , a second muscle disease is present and symptoms are worse than either disease in isolation amp deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate ( amp ) to inosine monophosphate ( imp ) , freeing an ammonia molecule in the process in order to use energy , a cell converts one of the above fuels into adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) via the mitochondria amp is normally converted into imp by myoadenylate deaminaseâ€”so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the purine nucleotide cycle the following is a very simplified model of what may be going on inside a muscle cell with ampd deficiency in muscle cells with ampd deficiency , atp production rate of the citric acid cycle will not be synchronized with atp demand it was demonstrated , that muscle cells , that lack ampd1 , stock and consume significantly more glutamate , and produce more alanine in this state , compared to healthy controls , which indicates occurrence of a higher concentration of pyruvate in the cell during exercise although probably unrelated to ampd deficiency , if the person happens to have a high load of d-lactate in the blood ( mostly from food and colonic fermentation ) , the precipitate , the lactate loss and the magnesium loss may occur even before l-lactate ( mostly from muscles ) reaches its renal re-absorption threshold it becomes hard to rapidly increase the load on a muscle , as in mcardle 's disease , and such a rapid load increase will dump even more purines into blood and urine ( looking like translucent or rust-colored sharp shiny crystals and being highly irritating ) oxidation of odd-numbered saturated fatty acids may provide another mechanism , although very gradual , to up-regulate citric acid cycle during exercise in case of leg muscles , where circulation is substantially dependent on their cyclical contraction when the body is upright , a small but useful degree of initial up-regulation of the citric acid cycle may be achieved just by standing still for a few minutes it is most useful when a long period of rest , or sitting in a vehicle , must be followed by brisk walking it probably happens because the digestive system senses and signals forthcoming delivery of sugars , inhibiting fatty acid release and oxidation , and starving glycogen-less muscle cells of the sole available source of energy if a large group of muscles is still actively drawing fuels from blood after the most recent continuous exercise , in order to replenish the atp and the phosphocreatine reserve , it may become sour without any additional exercise by the time the carbohydrate meal is finished the lactate is dumped back into blood and urine the higher the glycemic index of the food is , the greater proportion of carbohydrates ( and calories ) is wasted into urine the person may recall seeing a nightmare if carbohydrate-rich food is not consumed in this state , amp elimination from the cell eventually completes , glycogen stores can be replenished again , and the cell transitions back to the original state but with reduced atp pool and an up-regulated citric acid cycle it is important for madd patients to maintain strength and fitness without exercising or working to exhaustion
