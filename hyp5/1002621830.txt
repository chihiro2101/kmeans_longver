after world war & nbsp ; i , dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents by the mid-1930s , the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene ( perchloroethylene ) , or pce for short , as the solvent a plant does on-site cleaning the turnaround time is longer for a drop shop than for a local plant machines of this era were described as vented ; their drying exhausts were expelled to the atmosphere , the same as many modern tumble-dryer exhausts much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed , and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere non-polar solvents are also good for some fabrics , especially natural fabrics , as the solvent does not interact with any polar groups within the fabric garments are placed in the washing or extraction chamber ( referred to as the 'basket ' or 'drum ' ) , which constitutes the core of the machine the basket capacity is between about 10 and 40 & nbsp ; kg ( 22 to 88 & nbsp ; lb ) the solvent temperature is maintained at 30 & nbsp ; degrees celsius ( 86 & nbsp ; degrees fahrenheit ) , as a higher temperature may damage it garments are also checked for foreign objects some textile dyes are '' loose '' and will shed dye during solvent immersion the density of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm 3 at room temperature ( 70 % heavier than water ) , and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support at the end of the wash cycle , the machine starts a rinse cycle where the garment load is rinsed with freshly distilled solvent dispensed from the solvent tank the extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350–450 & nbsp ; rpm , causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric when no more solvent can be spun out , the machine starts the drying cycle after the drying cycle is complete , a deodorizing ( aeration ) cycle cools the garments and removes further traces of solvent , by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins it will contain solvent , powdered filter material ( diatomite ) , carbon , non-volatile residues , lint , dyes , grease , soils , and water a crossed-out empty circle indicates that dry cleaning is not permitted svg dry clean , hydrocarbon solvent only ( hcs ) file : professionelle reinigung ( f ) s.svg gentle cleaning with hydrocarbon solvents file : professionelle reinigung ( f ) ss.svg very gentle cleaning with hydrocarbon solvents file : professionelle reinigung ( p ) hydrocarbons are however pollutants hydrocarbons retain about 10-12 % of the market epa releases final health assessment for tce september 2011 the pump increases the pressure of the liquid carbon dioxide to approximately 900 to 1500 psi drycleaning and laundry institute '' the western cleaner & launderer , august 2007 as mentioned in the mechanisms section , dry cleaning utilizes both chemical and mechanical properties to remove stains fabrics are very poor conductors and so usually , this build-up is discharged through the solvent to compensate for the poor solubility and conductivity of supercritical carbon dioxide , research has focused on additives machinery for use of supercritical co 2 is expensive—up to 90,000 more than a pce machine , making affordability difficult for small businesses accessed 2014-jan-22 the exposure to the solvents in a typical dry cleaner is considered far below the levels required to cause any risk hazard summary provided by the united states environmental protection agency
