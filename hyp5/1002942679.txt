in the pulp and paper industry , edta inhibits the ability of metal ions , especially manganese , from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide , which is used in totally chlorine free in a similar manner , edta is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration , which is catalysed by metal ions us food and drug administration : center for food safety and applied nutrition questions and answers on the occurrence of benzene in soft drinks and other beverages the reduction of water hardness in laundry applications and the dissolution of scale in boilers both rely on edta and related complexants to bind calcium , magnesium , as well as other metal ions in a similar manner edta is used in the cement industry for the determination of free lime and free magnesia in cement and clinkers it is used in a similar manner to remove excess iron from the body these ideas are unsupported by scientific studies , and seem to contradict some currently accepted principles fda has not approved it for the treatment of atherosclerosis edta also acts as a selective inhibitor against dntp hydrolyzing enzymes ( taq polymerase , dutpase , mutt ) , liver arginase and horseradish peroxidase independently of metal ion chelation in analytical chemistry , edta is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses the same study also found that both dermal exposure to edta in most cosmetic formulations and inhalation exposure to edta in aerosolised cosmetic formulations would produce exposure levels below those seen to be toxic in oral dosing studies this route yields the tetrasodium edta , which is converted in a subsequent step into the acid forms : : h 2 nch 2 ch 2 nh 2 + 4 & nbsp ; formaldehyde + 4 & nbsp ; nacn + 4 & nbsp ; h 2 o → ( nao 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 na ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; ammonia : ( nao 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 na ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; hcl → ( ho 2 cch 2 ) 2 nch 2 ch 2 n ( ch 2 co 2 h ) 2 + 4 & nbsp ; nacl this process is used to produce about 80,000 & nbsp ; tonnes of edta each year in this article , the term edta is used to mean h 4−x edta x− , whereas in its complexes edta 4− stands for the tetraanion ligand image : metal-edta.svg thumb metal–edta chelate as found in co ( iii ) complexes hans peter latscha : analytische chemie edta is in such widespread use that questions have been raised whether it is a persistent organic pollutant in many industrial wastewater treatment plants , edta elimination can be achieved at about 80 % using microorganisms some microorganisms have even been discovered to form nitrates out of edta , but they function optimally at moderately alkaline conditions of ph 9.0–9.5 rather , each strain uniquely consumes varying metal–edta complexes through several enzymatic pathways candidate chelating agents include nitrilotriacetic acid ( nta ) , iminodisuccinic acid ( ids ) , polyaspartic acid , s , s-ethylenediamine-n , n′-disuccinic acid ( edds ) , methylglycinediacetic acid ( mgda ) , and l -glutamic acid n , n-diacetic acid , tetrasodium salt ( glda ) the s , s isomer of edta , edds ( edds ) is readily biodegradable and exhibits a high rate biodegradation trisodium dicarboxymethyl alaninate , also known as methylglycinediacetic acid ( mgda ) , has a high rate of biodegradation at over 68 % , but unlike many other chelating agents can degrade without the assistance of adapted bacteria additionally , unlike edds or ids , mgda can withstand higher temperatures while maintaining a high stability as well as the entire ph range . methods of detection and analysis the most sensitive method of detecting and measuring edta in biological samples is selected reaction monitoring capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry ( srm-ce/ms ) , which has a detection limit of 7.3 & nbsp ; ng/ml in human plasma and a detection limit of 15 & nbsp ; ng/ml
