eugene onegin : a dandy from saint petersburg , about 26 an arrogant , selfish , and world-weary cynic vladimir lensky : a young poet , about 18 a very romantic and naïve dreamer upon the death of a wealthy uncle , he inherits a substantial fortune and a landed estate lensky takes onegin to dine with the family of his fiancée , the sociable but rather thoughtless olga larina at this meeting , he also catches a glimpse of olga 's sister tatyana now she is married to an aged prince ( a general ) another major element is pushkin 's creation of a woman of intelligence and depth in tatyana , whose vulnerable sincerity and openness on the subject of love has made her the heroine of countless russian women , despite her apparent naïveté his inability to relate to the feelings of others and his entire lack of empathy – the cruelty instilled in him by the '' world '' – is epitomized in the very first stanza of the first book by his stunningly self-centered thoughts about being with the dying uncle whose estate he is to inherit : : '' but god how deadly dull to sample : sickroom attendance night and day : : and sighing ask oneself all through : '' when will the devil come for you ? '' c h johnston 's translation , adapted slightly however , the '' devil comes for onegin '' when he both literally and figuratively kills innocence and sincerity in shooting lensky in the duel and rejecting tatyana tatyana learns her lesson : armored against feelings and steeped in convention , she crushes his later sincerity and remorse he is a victim of his own pride and selfishness he is doomed to loneliness , and this is his tragedy the following dates mostly come from nabokov 's study of the photographs of pushkin 's drafts that were available at the time , as well as other people 's work on the subject many events occurred which interrupted the writing of chapter 3 except for xxv , stanzas i–xxxi were added on september 25 , 1824 he thought that it was finished on september 12 , 1825 , but later continued the process of rearranging , adding , and omitting stanzas until the first week of 1826 the first separate edition of chapter 4 appeared with chapter 5 in a publication produced between january 31 and february 2 , 1828 he left for this trip on september 4 and returned on november 2 , 1826 when nabokov carried out his study on the writing of onegin , the manuscript of chapter 6 was lost , but it is known that pushkin started chapter 6 before finishing chapter 5 most of chapter 6 appears to have been written before the beginning of december 19 , 1826 when pushkin returned to moscow after exile on his family estate where , due to an epidemic of cholera , he was forced to stay for three months during the summer of 1831 , pushkin revised and completed chapter 8 apart from '' onegin 's letter '' , which was completed on october 5 , 1831 very little of it survived in pushkin 's notebooks опыт реконструкции формы the first complete edition of the book was published in 1833 yuri lotman , роман а.с пушкина « евгений онегин » instead of asking onegin if he would like to apologise , he apologises for having much to do at home and leaves as soon as onegin ( obligatorily ) accepts the challenge onegin , against all rules , appoints his servant guillot as his second ( chapter 6 , stanza xxvii ) , a blatant insult for the nobleman zaretsky as the first shooter , he could n't show that he was deliberately trying to miss the opponent , because this was considered as a serious insult and could create a formal reason to appoint another duel ( poem is reproduced here ) nabokov reproduces the poem both so that the reader of his translation would have some experience of this unique form , and also to act as a further defence of his decision to write his translation in prose douglas hofstadter published a translation in 1999 , again preserving the onegin stanzas , after having summarised the controversy ( and severely criticised nabokov 's attitude towards verse translation ) in his book le ton beau de marot there are at least a dozen published translations of onegin in german blumenthal , moscow 1878 dr alexis lupus , nur das 1 müller
