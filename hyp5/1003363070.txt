bubble memory is largely the brainchild of a single person , andrew bobeck thumb in 1967 , bobeck joined a team at bell labs and started work on improving twistor this led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-domain twistor concept , but using a single block of magnetic material instead of many twistor wires attempts to magnetize smaller areas would fail with orthoferrite , if the patch was written and then a magnetic field was applied to the entire material , the patch would shrink down into a tiny circle , which he called a bubble for instance , in september 1974 , h.e.d michaelis and bobeck were awarded the ieee morris n the next problem was to make them move to the proper location where they could be read back out : twistor was a wire and there was only one place to go , but in a 2d sheet things would not be so easy better yet , bubble memory devices needed no moving parts : the field that pushed the bubbles along the surface was generated electrically , whereas media like tape and disk drives required mechanical movement finally , because of the small size of the bubbles , the density was in theory much higher than existing magnetic storage devices this sparked considerable interest in the industry by the mid-1970s , practically every large electronics company had teams working on bubble memory nicolet used bubble memory modules for saving waveforms in their model 3091 oscilloscope , as did hp who offered a 1595 bubble memory option that extended the memory on their model 3561a digital signal analyzer grid systems corporation used it in their early laptops
