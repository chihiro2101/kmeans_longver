typical requirements which are considered in the design process are : the filter should have a specific frequency response the filter should have a specific phase shift or group delay the filter should have a specific impulse response the filter should be causal the filter should be stable the filter should be localized ( pulse or step inputs should result in finite time outputs ) the computational complexity of the filter should be low the filter should be implemented in particular hardware or software to achieve steeper slopes , higher-order filters are required a high-pass filter passes high frequencies fairly well ; it is helpful as a filter to cut any unwanted low-frequency components a differentiator has an amplitude response proportional to the frequency a high-shelf filter passes all frequencies , but increases or reduces frequencies above the shelf frequency by specified amount phase and group delay an all-pass filter passes through all frequencies unchanged , but changes the phase of the signal however , in certain applications it may be the filter 's impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements for example , we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter and that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible in order to be implementable , any time-dependent filter ( operating in real time ) must be causal : the filter response only depends on the current and past inputs filters that do not operate in real time ( e.g allows the design of zero delay recursive filters , where the group delay of a causal filter is canceled by its hermitian non-causal filter in certain applications , this desire is a strict requirement , for example due to limited computational resources , limited power resources , or limited time another issue related to computational complexity is separability , that is , if and how a filter can be written as a convolution of two or more simpler filters , be to approximate some desired filter as a separable filter or as a sum of separable filters the main disadvantage is that they may require significantly more processing and memory resources than cleverly designed iir variants the complexity ( i.e parts of the design problem relate to the fact that certain requirements are described in the frequency domain while others are expressed in the signal domain and that these may contradict this is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise the variance extension theorem the ideal impulse response can be chosen independently of the ideal frequency function and is in practice used to limit the effective width and to remove ringing effects of the resulting filter in the signal domain
