they are categorized as actin fold proteins , sharing a common atp binding site core that is surrounded by more variable sequences which determine substrate affinities and other properties multicellular organisms including plants and animals often have more than one hexokinase isoform hexokinases i , ii , and iii are referred to as '' low-k m '' isozymes because of a high affinity for glucose ( below 1 mm ) hexokinases i and ii follow michaelis-menten kinetics at physiologic concentrations of substrates molecular weights are around 100 kd hexokinase i/a is found in all mammalian tissues , and is considered a '' housekeeping enzyme , '' unaffected by most physiological , hormonal , and metabolic changes it is the hexokinase found in muscle and heart hexokinase iv ( '' glucokinase '' ) mammalian hexokinase iv , also referred to as glucokinase , differs from other hexokinases in kinetics and functions in the beta cells of the pancreatic islets , it serves as a glucose sensor to control insulin release , and similarly controls glucagon release in the alpha cells by catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose to yield glucose 6-phosphate , hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells
