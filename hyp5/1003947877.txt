aerostats include free balloons , airships , and moored balloons an aerostat 's main structural component is its envelope , a lightweight skin that encloses a volume of lifting gas walker 2000 , p quote : the gas-bag of a balloon or airship . unpowered flight versus powered flight the wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs , but differ significantly in structure ; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of arthropods '' nature , volume 385 , issue 385 , february 1997 , pp bats are the only mammals capable of sustaining level flight ( see bat flight ) most species of insects can fly as adults insect flight makes use of either of two basic aerodynamic models : creating a leading edge vortex , found in most insects , and using clap and fling , found in very small insects such as thrips supersonic flight is flight faster than the speed of sound essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight , spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space examples include ballistic missiles , orbital spaceflight , etc some vehicles also use thrust for flight , for example rockets and harrier jump jets air propulsion ( except in gliders ) lift , created by the reaction to an airflow drag , created by aerodynamic friction weight , created by gravity buoyancy , for lighter than air flight these forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur french 1970 , p '' what is drag ? '' nasa '' motions of particles through fluids however , this lift ( deflection ) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag cl l / ( a cd d / ( a a greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection , and thus generates extra lift if an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms , it rises in the air thrust-to-weight ratio is , as its name suggests , the ratio of instantaneous thrust to weight ( where weight means weight at the earth 's standard acceleration g_0 ) sutton and biblarz 2000 , p quote : '' thrust-to-weight ratio f/w 0 is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system ( expressed in multiples of g0 ) if it could fly by itself in a gravity free vacuum all animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off in aircraft , successful air navigation involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost , breaking the laws applying to aircraft , or endangering the safety of those on board or on the earth in the latter case , the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments and radio navigation aids such as beacons , or as directed under radar control by air traffic control in the vfr case , a pilot will largely navigate using dead reckoning combined with visual observations ( known as pilotage ) , with reference to appropriate maps the oxford illustrated dictionary newtonian mechanics ( the m.i.t norton & company inc beschreibung der konstruktion der triebwerksanlagen new york : wiley-interscience , 2000 ( 7th edition ) edinburgh : chambers harrap publishers ltd 'birds in flight and aeroplanes ' by evolutionary biologist and trained engineer john maynard-smith freeview video provided by the vega science trust .
