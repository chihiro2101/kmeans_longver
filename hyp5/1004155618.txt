at the regional or national level ( i.e above the constituency level ) several different calculation methods have been used , but the basic characteristic of the mmp is that the total number of seats in the assembly , including the single-member seats and not only the party-list ones , are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot if a party wins more fptp seats than the proportional quota received by the party-list vote , these surplus seats become overhang seats to work towards restoring a full proportionality for example , in the 2008 new zealand general election the māori party won 2.4 % of the party vote , which would entitle them to 0 seats in the house , but won 5 constituency seats , leaving an overhang of 2 seats , which resulted in a 122-member house in new zealand the threshold is 5 % , in bolivia 3 % , in germany 5 % for elections for federal parliament and most state parliaments mmp is currently in use in : bolivia adopted mmp in 1994 wales – the devolved senedd cymru-welsh parliament uses mmp with each electoral region normally electing 8 local mss ( with exceptions to 2 regions ) and 4 regional mss london – the devolved london assembly uses mmp with 14 ams elected locally and 11 ams elected from citywide lists unlike the other two assemblies that use the system , parties have to pass a threshold of 5 % of the regional votes in order to be eligible for the list seats on august 6 , 2020 the state council of tigray decided to amend its constitution and change the electoral system to mmp , this will affect the upcoming regional elections in 2007 , the citizens ' assembly on electoral reform in ontario , canada , also recommended the use of mmp in future elections to the legislative assembly of ontario , with a ballot similar to new zealand 's , and with the closed province-wide lists used in new zealand but with only 30 % compensatory members during october–december 2018 , british columbia held a referendum on proportional representation , promised as part of the election platform of the bc ndp who took office following the may 2017 provincial election if pr had been successful on the first question , mmp would have been adopted in time for the next provincial election and would have been subject to a second referendum after two election cycles the bill presented by the citizen power now movement and endorsed by the majority of parliamentary groups would create two types of deputies ; 42 elected proportionally by lists presented by the political parties and would be called '' national '' deputies , whilst another 42 deputies would be elected directly by population-based electoral districts on a first pass the post basis in september 2015 , sri lankan foreign minister mangala samaraweera announced that they will change the country 's system to mmp the independent electoral commission ( iec ) has stated that it is not opposed to an amendment but there is simply not enough time to implement it in time for the 2019 elections this tactic is the same in any method of proportional representation with a threshold this tactic is much less effective in mmp models with a relatively large share of list seats ( 50 % in most german states , and 42.5 % in the new zealand house of representatives ) and/or ones which add '' balance seats '' , leading to less opportunities for overhangs and maintaining full proportionality even when a party wins too many constituency seats see blog articles on the 2007 and 2012 elections posted by political science professor matthew sobery shugard , university of california in davis fruits and votes – lesotho page another interesting case is that of venezuela , which also ended up changing its system , in this case by formally adopting a parallel voting system and legitimizing party efforts to game the mmp approach in addition to the wikipedia page on the 2010 election , see the section titled '' why 'only ' 49 % of the vote and 59 % of the legislators ?
