a cannabis plant includes more than 400 different chemicals , of which about 70 are cannabinoids the number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study comparative studies have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as prochlorperazine , promethazine , and metoclopramide in controlling cinv , but these are used less frequently because of side effects including dizziness , dysphoria , and hallucinations a 2016 cochrane review said that cannabinoids were '' probably effective '' in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children , but with a high side-effect profile ( mainly drowsiness , dizziness , altered moods , and increased appetite ) research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for neuropathic pain , spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders the drug use must be '' implicated '' in the emergency department visit , but does not need to be the direct cause of the visit one study suggested that sustained heavy , daily , adolescent onset cannabis use over decades is associated with a decline in iq by age 38 , with no effects found in those who initiated cannabis use later , or in those who ceased use earlier in adulthood evidence for causing these cancers is mixed concerning heavy , long-term use people are provided licenses with the help of which , they can either grow medical cannabis , or purchase it legally throughout the state studies of long-term effects on cognition have provided conflicting results , with some studies finding no difference between long-term abstainers and never-users and others finding long-term deficits exposure to thc can cause acute transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and people with schizophrenia a 2004 literature review on the subject concluded that cannabis use is associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of psychosis , but that cannabis use is '' neither necessary nor sufficient '' to cause psychosis the most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol ( or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol , commonly known as thc ) the most studied are thc , cbd and cbn cb1 and cb2 are the primary cannabinoid receptors responsible for several of the effects of cannabinoids , although other receptors may play a role as well both belong to a group of receptors called g protein-coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) oral administration has the lowest bioavailability of approximately 6 % , variable absorption depending on the vehicle used , and the longest time to peak plasma levels ( 2 to 6 hours ) compared to smoked or vaporized thc like cannabinoid absorption , distribution is also dependent on route of administration delta-9-thc is the primary molecule responsible for the effects of cannabis delta-9-thc is metabolized in the liver and turns into 11-oh-thc both delta-9-thc and 11-oh-thc are psychoactive ingestion of edible cannabis products lead to a slower onset of effect than the inhalation of it because the thc travels to the liver first through the blood before it travels to the rest of the body the terminal half-life of thc is 25 to 36 hours , whereas for cbd it is 18 to 32 hours its metabolites are products of primarily cyp2c19 and cyp3a4 activity , with potential activity of cyp1a1 , cyp1a2 , cyp2c9 , and cyp2d6 similar to delta-9-thc , a majority of cbd is excreted in feces and some in the urine cannabinoid medicines are available in pill form ( dronabinol and nabilone ) and liquid extracts formulated into an oromucosal spray ( nabiximols ) '' an archaeological and historical account of cannabis in china '' , economic botany 28.4:437–448 , p the ebers papyrus ( c surviving texts from ancient india confirm that cannabis ' psychoactive properties were recognized , and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments , including insomnia , headaches , gastrointestinal disorders , and pain , including during childbirth widely cultivated strains of cannabis , such as '' afghani '' or '' hindu kush '' , are indigenous to the pakistan and afghanistan regions , while '' durban poison '' is native to africa in 1845 french physician jacques-joseph moreau published a book about the use of cannabis in psychiatry hans bangen : geschichte der medikamentösen therapie der schizophrenie also , the advent of the hypodermic syringe allowed these drugs to be injected for immediate effect , in contrast to cannabis which is not water-soluble and therefore can not be injected in the united states , the medical use of cannabis further declined with the passage of the marihuana tax act of 1937 , which imposed new regulations and fees on physicians prescribing cannabis pharmacopeia in 1941 , and officially banned for any use with the passage of the controlled substances act of 1970 '' dà má '' ( pinyin

netherlands . positions of medical organizations medical organizations that have issued statements in support of allowing access to medical cannabis include the american nurses association , american public health association , american medical student association , national multiple sclerosis society , epilepsy foundation , and leukemia & lymphoma society the american heart association says that '' many of the concerning health implications of cannabis include cardiovascular diseases '' but that it supports rescheduling to allow '' more nuanced the authors of a report on a 2011 survey of medical cannabis users say that critics have suggested that some users '' game the system '' to obtain medical cannabis ostensibly for treatment of a condition , but then use it for nonmedical purposes – though the truth of this claim is hard to measure in the us , the fda has approved two oral cannabinoids for use as medicine : dronabinol and nabilone trials for fda approval in the us are underway they developed , and in 1987 gained permission to market , the pharmaceutical '' canasol '' , one of the first cannabis extracts
