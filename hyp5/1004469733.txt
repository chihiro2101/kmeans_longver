the first ferry to convey passengers , horses and carriages began operation from russell street c.1842 land between the new burial ground and barracks was put up for auction in 1861 , and from 1863 the auctioning of suburban allotments ( now paddington ) encouraged the spread of the settlement along the ridges the extension on the main line railway from ipswich to brisbane in 1875 isolated the strip of riverfront residences from the working-class houses in milton and paddington , and this contributed to the relative lack of development along the northern bank of the milton reach of the river in subsequent years in the 1880s , the south bank experienced a development boom on 3 october 1903 , the queensland government gazetted the proclamation which constituted the city of south brisbane land resumption for road widening was enacted in both stanley and melbourne streets , and in september 1925 , south brisbane city council is noted as having a population of 40,000 persons in 1930 the completion of the sydneyâ€“brisbane rail corridor benefited the local economy with a demand for factory and manufacturing sites as a result , when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the grey street bridge , there was scant opposition a motion was passed on 20 may 1925 to appoint a cross river commission , which reported on 11 january 1926 ( chairman roger hawken , professor of engineering at the university of queensland , william muir nelson and ronald martin wilson ) the report showed 11 proposed river crossings , and considered costs and savings made due to the reduction in haulage costs etc these reports proposed the grey street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic , and a second bridge from wellington road to sydney street , new farm , with a major ring road called the main parkway boulevard , be constructed the existing gilchrist avenue 's original drawings are dated 25 june 1930 problems were encountered with the design of the bridge due to the depth of rock below the river bed increasing from approximately on the southern bank harding frew considered five bridge types , each a variation on a theme , stating in his report that : '' it is frankly admitted that the purely economical aspect alone has not been given as much weight changed from design to construction work commenced in august 1928 and was completed in march 1932 as mentioned , the depth-to-rock over much of the length of the william jolly bridge posed a major problem in the design of the foundations the original design had the piers supported on timber piles , with inclined piles to resist the thrust from the small arch hornibrook is quoted as stating : '' '' the use of sand islands was highly successful and very accurate , and overcame the problem of requiring the cutting edge to be placed directly on dry ground between 1904-1909 this method was modified to spray sand and cement using a machine known as a cement- gun it would appear that the use of gunite in the arches , beams , deck members and hangers of the main spans , is a major early use of the process in australia the cement and aggregate was supplied by the queensland cement and lime company provision for a major water pipe never eventuated , and the closer spacing of stringers in the centre to support a tramway was not utilised the extent of work included in the bridge contract excluded some retaining walls , roadways etc a large crowd gathered on both sides of the river and 600 invited guests were in attendance these fittings were replaced by the present lighting in 1964 a cream colour was chosen to reflect the approximate colour of newly poured concrete the william jolly bridge crosses the brisbane river at the tip of the south brisbane peninsula between grey street , south brisbane , and north quay at the intersection of skew and saul streets on the northern bank the two smaller arches at the northern embankment are no longer extant , and have been replaced by precast , prestressed concrete deck units above coronation drive , which links onto the riverside expressway this was incorrect as the bridge was designed as a reinforced concrete structure , with the steelwork acting as reinforcing and the concrete carrying a major part of the load these four tower-like elements frame both entrances to the bridge , surmounting the end piers of the cross-river section , and each consists of an arched opening to a projecting balcony with a stepped crown surmounted by a metal spire although designed to reduce congestion on the existing victoria bridge and within the cbd , the bridge created new congestion issues of its own , as it put considerable pressure on the normanby fiveways intersection making it one of brisbane 's most congested and dangerous intersections in 2003 the bridge was a location for the filming of inspector gadget 2 the cost of the project was 2,000,000 william jolly bridge was listed on the queensland heritage register on 6 august 1996 having satisfied the following criteria the place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of queensland 's history the construction of the bridge was seen as a symbol of the unification of greater brisbane , and the bridge bears the name of the new city council 's first mayor , and later lord mayor , william alfred jolly , who was chairman of the bridges and ferries committee and who had moved the motions which led to the construction of the bridge it was brisbane 's second traffic bridge and provided an important transport and communications link between both sides of the river , as well as further impetus for the development of the south brisbane peninsula the design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck , which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality bridges over the brisbane river
