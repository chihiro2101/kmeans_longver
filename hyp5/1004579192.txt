also , because the central directory specifies the offset of each file in the archive with respect to the start , it is possible for the first file entry to start at an offset other than zero , although some tools , for example gzip , will not process archive files that do not start with a file entry at offset zero self-extracting archives ( sfx ) , of the form supported by winzip , take advantage of this , in that they are executable files that conform to the pkzip appnote.txt specification , and can be read by compliant zip tools or libraries this property of the format , and of the jar format which is a variant of zip , can be exploited to hide rogue content ( such as harmful java classes ) inside a seemingly harmless file , such as a gif image uploaded to the web the minimum size of a file is 22 bytes the remaining ids can be used by third-party vendors for proprietary usage when winzip 9.0 public beta was released in 2003 , winzip introduced its own aes-256 encryption , using a different file format , along with the documentation for the new specification in the end , pkware and winzip agreed to support each other 's products zip tools , available on various platforms the info-zip windows tools also support ntfs filesystem permissions , and will make an attempt to translate from ntfs permissions to unix permissions or vice versa when extracting files for example , encryption is not supported in windows 10 home edition , although it can decrypt likewise , the zlib format ( ietf also uses the deflate compression algorithm , but specifies different headers for error and consistency checking
