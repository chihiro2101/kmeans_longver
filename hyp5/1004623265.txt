the resulting knot is a sum of the original knots depending on how this is done , two different knots ( but no more ) may result the knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative there is a prime decomposition for knots , analogous to prime and composite numbers while you can not form the unknot in three dimensions by adding two non-trivial knots , you can in higher dimensions , at least when one considers smooth knots in codimension at least 3 in 2003 rankin , flint , and schermann , tabulated the alternating knots through 22 crossings briggs and later extended by dale rolfsen in his knot table ( see image above and list of prime knots ) the dowker–thistlethwaite notation , also called the dowker notation or code , for a knot is a finite sequence of even integers for example , in this figure the knot diagram has crossings labelled with the pairs ( 1,6 ) ( 3 , & minus ; 12 ) ( 5,2 ) ( 7,8 ) ( 9 , & minus ; 4 ) and ( 11 , & minus ; 10 ) the conway notation for knots and links , named after john horton conway , is based on the theory of tangles start with a basic polyhedron , a 4-valent connected planar graph with no digon regions such a polyhedron is denoted first by the number of vertices then a number of asterisks which determine the polyhedron 's position on a list of basic polyhedra any link admits such a description , and it is clear this is a very compact notation even for very large crossing number for an algebraic knot such as in the first example , 1 is often omitted other good texts from the references are and lickorish is a rigorous introduction for graduate students , covering a nice mix of classical and modern topics its aim was to use knots to present methods of mathematics to the general public knotinfo : table of knot invariants and knot theory resources the knot atlas — detailed info on individual knots in knot tables knotplot — software to investigate geometric properties of knots knotscape — software to create images of knots knoutilus — online database and image generator of knots knotdata.html — wolfram mathematica function for investigating knots
