as early as 1911 , william s she reported that she was unable to wake him at these times the sadlers and others involved , now all deceased , claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them , with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935 sadler and his son william ( bill ) sadler , jr '' the communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the forum studied the book in depth , and according to sadler and others , permission to publish it was given to them in 1955 a statistical analysis using the mosteller and wallace methods of stylometry indicates at least nine authors were involved , and by comparatively analyzing the book against the mind at mischief , does not indicate authorship or extensive editing by sadler , without ruling out the possibility of limited edits mcmullan and the michael foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the urantia foundation 's us copyright in the urantia book was either invalid or , alternatively , that the copyright had not been infringed upon these two arguments having been rejected , a u.s this decision was upheld on appeal in 2006 , the international copyright on the english text expired it presents narratives on the inhabitants of local universes and their work as it

upholder of all reality—an omniscient , omnipresent , omnipotent , infinity , and eternal spirit personality in no manner violates the truth of the divine unity the persons of god the ultimate and god the absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis '' a divine creator son is considered the highest personification of the universal father and eternal son that is possible for people to know and : '' is , to all practical intents and purposes , god '' jesus of nazareth is identified as a creator son who incarnated on earth , and the central theme of the book 's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world the final paper states : god and the individual constant selfishness and sinful choosing lead eventually to iniquity and full identification with unrighteousness , and since unrighteousness is unreal , it results in the eventual annihilation of the individual 's identity uniting with the adjuster fragment is the '' reward of the ages , '' the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life , described as typically taking place in the afterlife , but also a possibility during earthly life the book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary isle of paradise—the dwelling place of god—with paradise being surrounded by '' havona , '' an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds , around which seven incomplete and evolutionary '' superuniverses '' circle history and future of the world progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers , which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of '' light and life '' in the far distant future jesus is held in high regard by the urantia book , as he is in the new testament of the bible he was crucified , and on the third day after his death , rose from the dead he will return to the world again some day jesus is considered the human incarnation of '' michael of nebadon , '' one of more than 700,000 '' paradise sons '' of god , or '' creator sons while the book supports aspects of adventism , it also is mixed with teachings that are heresies to adventists the papers are informational , matter-of-fact , and instructional martin gardner considers part iv to be an especially '' well-written , impressive work , '' and says , '' either it is accurate in its history , coming directly from higher beings in position to know , or it is a work of fertile imagination by someone who knew the new testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when jesus lived criticisms of claims as a revelation because the book does not support certain tenets of christianity , such as the atonement doctrine , while at the same time presenting an account of parts of jesus ' life absent in the bible , others with a christian viewpoint have argued it can not be genuine the cosmology of these revelations is not inspired the particle is not known to be described anywhere else and the concept is at odds with modern particle physics scientists further established that mercury is locked in this spin rate in a stable resonance of 3 spins for every 2 orbits , and it is not slowing and so will never have one side left always turned to the sun the theory originated with dutch botanist hugo de vries but was short-lived and is not now supported the book erroneously says that a solar eclipse was predicted in 1808 by the native american prophet tenskwatawa the eclipse actually was predicted in late april 1806 and occurred on june 16 , 1806 gardner recounts that william s because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935 while then was not being published until 1955 , discoveries from science during the two intervening decades are often declared to be prophetic by believers , while skeptics point out that edits could have been made to the book up to its 1955 publication in 1992 , a reader of the urantia book , matthew block , self-published a paper that showed the urantia book utilized material from 15 other books each section of the paper corresponds to a chapter in the book , with several passages possibly used as direct material and further material used in papers 86-90 and 92 ( in addition to the book 's '' heavy indebtedness to hopkins , '' gardner discovered that hopkins was a major reference in an earlier book authored by sadler , adding to gardner 's view that it is more likely sadler had a hand in writing or editing the urantia book than that celestial beings wrote it swann writes on page 64 of the architecture of the universe ( italics indicate edits as compared to the urantia book , bolding indicates deletions ) : contrast with the urantia book ' s version : block and other believers do not see the use of the source materials as plagiarism , but express a view instead that the quality of the way the material was borrowed is consistent with authorship by celestial beings and that study of the sources leads to an even deeper understanding of the urantia book sales by urantia foundation went from 7,000 in 1990 to 24,700 in 1997 , and steadily increased to nearly 38,000 in 2000 , an '' upturn that seems to represent a genuine trend rather than just some spike on a sales chart , '' but in 2011 the foundation reported worldwide annual sales of 16,000 copies and over 60,000 downloads from various sites since the book was determined to be in the public domain in 2001 , other organizations , such as the urantia book fellowship under the publishing name uversa press , have also published the book several audio books of the text are also on the internet the international urantia association had twenty-six reader associations worldwide as of 2002 , and the urantia book fellowship ( formerly the urantia brotherhood , founded in 1955 with
