in plant biology , pectin consists of a complex set of polysaccharides ( see below ) that are present in most primary cell walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants in human digestion , pectin binds to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract and slows glucose absorption by trapping carbohydrates pectinaceous surface pellicles , which are rich in pectin , create a mucilage layer that holds in dew that helps the cell repair its dna the effect depends upon the source of pectin ; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fiber pectin the mechanism appears to be an increase of viscosity in the intestinal tract , leading to a reduced absorption of cholesterol from bile or food substituted galacturonans are characterized by the presence of saccharide appendant residues ( such as d-xylose or d-apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan ) branching from a backbone of d-galacturonic acid residues rhamnogalacturonan ii is classified by some authors within the group of substituted galacturonans since the rhamnogalacturonan ii backbone is made exclusively of d-galacturonic acid units low-methoxy pectins ( short hm-pectins vs here , some of the galacturonic acid is converted with ammonia to carboxylic acid amide high-ester pectins set at higher temperatures than low-ester pectins similarly , lower ph-values or higher soluble solids ( normally sugars ) increase gelling speeds max wichtl ( emer january 2004 , page 520 an old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used ( apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations , pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents ) water extract of aiyu seeds is traditionally used in taiwan to make aiyu jelly , where the extract gels without heating due to low-ester pectins from the seeds and the bivalent cations from the water until 2002 , it was one of the main ingredients used in kaopectate a medication to combat diarrhea , along with kaolinite the authors reported on the positive results of using pectin food additive preparations in a number of clinical studies conducted on children in severely polluted areas , with up to 50 % improvement over control groups yablokov , alexey v chernobyl consequences of the catastrophe for people and the environment john wiley & sons , 2010 , pp the printing process at first proved nearly impossible because the several layers of ink immediately ran , blurring outlines and rendering place names illegible until the inventor of the maps , clayton hutton , mixed a little pectin with the ink and at once the pectin coagulated the ink and prevented it from running , allowing small topographic features to be clearly visible chemical risks in food international pectin producers association â€“ 13 june 2007
