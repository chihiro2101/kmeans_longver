paget-schroetter disease or upper extremity dvt ( uedvt ) is the obstruction of an arm vein ( such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein ) by a thrombus the condition usually comes to light after vigorous exercise and usually presents in younger , otherwise healthy people men are affected more than women cerebral venous sinus thrombosis the mortality rate is 4.3 % staphyloccoal or streptococcal infections of the face , for example nasal or upper lip pustules may thus spread directly into the cavernous sinus , causing stroke-like symptoms of double vision , squint , as well as spread of infection to cause meningitis alternatively , arterial occlusion occurs as a consequence of embolism of blood clots originating from the heart ( '' cardiogenic '' emboli ) since blockage of the artery is gradual , onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower a lesion is then formed which is the infarct mi can quickly become fatal if emergency medical treatment is not received promptly hepatic artery thrombosis usually occurs as a devastating complication after liver transplantation thrombosis prevention is initiated with assessing the risk for its development the main causes of thrombosis are given in virchow 's triad which lists thrombophilia , endothelial cell injury , and disturbed blood flow in addition , arterial and cardiac clots are normally rich in plateletsâ€“which are required for clot formation in areas under high stress due to blood flow also , treatments for cancer ( radiation , chemotherapy ) often cause additional hypercoagulability a thrombus may become detached and enter circulation as an embolus , finally lodging in and completely obstructing a blood vessel , which unless treated very quickly will lead to tissue necrosis ( an infarction ) in the area past the occlusion venous thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism when the migrated embolus becomes lodged in the lung generally , a risk-benefit analysis is required , as all anticoagulants lead to an increased risk of bleeding warfarin and vitamin k antagonists are anticoagulants that can be taken orally to reduce thromboembolic occurrence this carries an increased risk of bleeding so is generally only used for specific situations ( such as severe stroke or a massive pulmonary embolism ) hence , protective therapies are required to attenuate iri alongside reperfusion in acute ischemic conditions to improve clinical outcomes of these , ric has the most robust clinical evidence , especially in the context of stemi , but also emerging for other indications such as acute ischemic stroke and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage .
