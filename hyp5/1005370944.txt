the first pedestrian crossing signal was erected in bridge street , westminster , london , in december 1868 it is surely a scandal that on the common ways there should be undue apprehension in the minds of the weakest users of them '' the times , 14 feb 14 : the pedestrian 's chances c ) central reservation d ) zebra crossing h ) pedestrian signal in the intersection i ) pedestrian overpass or underpass this facility eliminates the conflict between vehicular traffic and pedestrian , but need to be supported by some form of physical restriction preventing pedestrians from crossing at level , as they perceived the additional effort to climb the overpass there are many varieties of signal and marking layouts around the world and even within single countries in places where there is very high pedestrian traffic , embedded pavement flashing-light systems are used to signal traffic of pedestrian presence , or pedestrian scramble ( also known as barnes dances ) may be used , which stop vehicular traffic in all directions at the same time another relatively widespread variation is the curb extension ( also known as a bulb-out ) , which narrows the width of the street and is used in combination with crosswalk markings the section of road should be swept clean and kept dry then they spray or brush a primer layer on the asphalt or concrete surface the thermoplastic paint in powder form is then melted into a molten liquid state for painting finally , the painter pulls or pushes the striping machine with the guide rod along the guiding line other crossings worldwide also feature some of roadsworth 's work , including a crosswalk in montreal where the zebra stripes are shaped like bullets , as well as '' conveyor belt '' crosswalk in winston-salem , north carolina cities have chosen to install their own designs some more innovative crossing treatments include in-pavement flashers , yellow flashing warning lights installed in the roadway , or hawk beacon—an overhead signal with a pair of red beacons above an amber beacon , when a pedestrian is detected or actuates the device it begins a sequence of amber flashing followed by a solid red , followed by a flashing red phase that allows motorists to proceed , only if the pedestrian ( s ) are clear of the travel way that portion of a roadway included within the extension of the boundary lines of sidewalks at intersections where the intersecting roadways meet at approximately right angles , except the extension of such lines from an alley across a street '' ) all states except maine and michigan require vehicles to yield to a pedestrian who has entered an unmarked crosswalk these particular colors are used in north america ( excluding quebec ) to provide conspicuity against the backdrop of red , yellow , and green traffic lights ; however , as of the 2003 mutcd , this was replaced by an optional '' animated eyes '' indication within the pedestrian signal display , which was placed in the mutcd following a study that recommended the usage of the '' animated eyes '' signal on fully actuated signals , or semi-actuated traffic signals , pressing the button to cross a smaller side street will cause an '' instant walk signal '' at signalized intersections without separate pedestrian signal heads , the traffic signals may be programmed to turn red in all directions , followed by a steady display of yellow lights simultaneously with the red indications in the united kingdom and certain parts of the commonwealth of nations , animal names are often used to distinguish several types of such crossings the highest rate is in the uk , which has fewer crossings than neighbouring european countries in france , it is not mandatory that crosswalks exist code de la route , article r412-37 4126 - thun - marktgasse at grabenstrasse.jpg crosswalk at intersection , in thun , switzerland 7154 - zürich - central.jpg crosswalk at zurich tramway central station panneaux suisses 3.02 2.41.1.jpg crosswalk before a roundabout , switzerland some countries in europe , have used the word pedestrian crossing in some treaties , for instance in the sentence '' a vehicle shall not overtake another vehicle which is approaching a pedestrian crossing marked on the carriageway or signposted as such , or which is stopped immediately before the crossing , otherwise than at a speed low enough to enable it to stop immediately if a pedestrian is on the crossing '' ( §6.b iii ) '' to cross the carriageway elsewhere than at a pedestrian crossing signposted as such or indicated by markings on the carriageway , pedestrians shall not step on to the carriageway without first making sure that they can do so without impeding vehicular traffic '' ( §6.c ) '' once they have started to cross a carriageway , pedestrians shall not take an unnecessarily long route , and shall not linger or stop on the carriageway unnecessarily it may appear at many locations that nothing happens however , in instances of the latter case , such as new york city 's , the buttons were simply deactivated when traffic signals were updated to automatically include pedestrian phases as part of every signal cycle with the mutcd guideline allotting at least one second to cross , this indicates that countdown timers are supposed to be installed on roads wider than however , other cities such as london found that countdown timers were effective , and new york city found that countdown signals worked mainly at longer crosswalks in taiwan , all the crossings feature animated men called xiaoluren ( '' little green man '' ) , who will walk faster immediately before the traffic signal will change there are also female ampelmännchen in western germany and the netherlands the department felt that extending the walk phase permanently on cross streets would cause too much disruption to traffic flow on the highway and so the keywalk system was developed to allow for those who needed an extended green light phase to cross the road safely keywalk for the disabled is an australian first ( march 1995 ) western roads : official journal of main roads , western australia , 18 ( 4 ) , p.10 it is unclear what became of this system illuminating engineering society of north america american national standard practice for roadway lighting watson , and r field test for lighting to improve safety at pedestrian crosswalks these systems illuminate the crosswalk as well as surrounding areas , and do not always provide enough contrast between the pedestrian and his or her background there have been many efforts to create lighting scenarios that offer better nighttime illumination in crosswalks some innovative concepts include : skinner , and m.s new jersey department of transportation , trenton , nj , 2009 van houten , ron and & malenfant , j.e on multilane roads carrying over 15,000 vehicles per day , a marked crosswalk is likely to have worse safety performance than an unmarked location , even if raised median refuges are provided
