list of common symptoms : '' sac-like '' appearance of the vocal folds hoarseness and deepening of the voice trouble speaking ( dysphonia ) reduced vocal range with diminished upper limits stretching of the mucosa ( distension ) shortness of breath ( dyspnoea ) reinke 's edema is characterized by a '' sac-like '' appearance of the vocal folds it is described as a harsh and breathy tone of voice the swelling of the vocal cords and the lowering of the voice are warning signs that an individual has reinke 's edema other factors include gastroesophageal reflux , hypothyroidism and chronic overuse of the voice for example , an individual who smokes and also has gastric reflux would have an increased susceptibility for developing reinke 's edema over time because males have lower pitched voices than females , males are less likely to observe a significant changes in the voice , and are therefore less likely to seek treatment because the disease is heavily linked to smoking , there is no established way to screen for reinke 's edema therefore , it is critical to maintain a non-smoking lifestyle even after surgery , because the fluid can re-emerge in fact , in many cases surgeons will not perform surgery without the guarantee that the individual will stop smoking accumulation of fluid within the reinke 's space alters the elasticity of the vocal cord , making it less stiff and more gelatinous tissue analysis of reinke 's edema shows decreased amounts of the proteins fibronectin , elastin , collagens i and iii , and extracellular matrix proteins there is no familial or heredity link to reinke 's edema laryngoscopes can be rigid or flexible flexible laryngoscopes , such as fiber laryngoscopes , allow the patient to produce sound as the tube is placed , and therefore allows the doctor to visualize movement of the vocal cord the first step in treating reinke 's edema is to eliminate or control those risk factors that are causing the disease those experiencing a hoarseness of the voice may choose to undergo voice therapy to improve the voice 's quality and range the flap is then re-draped and trimmed to the appropriate size other complications of surgery include tissue scarring due to damage to the vocal ligament during the incision and vocal cord stiffening due to over-suctioning of the superficial lamina propria ( reinke 's space ) before the hirano microflap method was developed in 1895 , vocal stripping was the most common procedure used to correct reinke 's edema vocal stripping was often performed without magnification and with a monocular laryngoscope , instead of a binocular scope surgery is capable of restoring the voice , with the condition that smoking is not resumed after surgery research has suggested the role of bacterial colony in neoplastic lesions such as reinke 's edema
