pawn structure is a set of penalties and bonuses for various strengths and weaknesses in pawn structure , such as penalties for doubled and isolated pawns the weights c1 , etc the equation is a conceptual model in a particular implementation , each composite pseudo-term may be represented by a handful to possibly hundreds of individual terms , each with its own weight or computed value other special factors that are often considered are : development of the minor pieces , rooks on open files or the seventh rank , doubled rooks , outpost knights ( knights in central locations protected by a pawn and not subject to attack by an opposing pawn ) , possession of the bishop pair , bishops on the long diagonals , pieces occupying or bearing on spaces around the opposing king , and mobility of the kings ( kings should n't be 'cramped ' , hence subject to mate-on-the-move ) the terms composing some factors , like king safety , combine non-linearly - one weakness in king safety , like an open file adjacent to the king , may be penalized for example , by 1/4 pawn , but two weaknesses may need to be penalized one or even two full pawns , and three weaknesses by a piece , a rook or even more because checkmate is becoming a likely possibility in practice , effective evaluation functions are created not by ever expanding the list of evaluated parameters , but by careful tuning of the weights relative to each other , of a modest set of parameters such as those described above an important technique in evaluation since at least the early 1990s , is the use of piece-square tables ( also called piece-value tables ) for evaluation each table is a set of 64 values corresponding to the squares of the chessboard the values encode a composite of many subtle factors difficult to quantify analytically evaluation in monte-carlo tree search the result , win , lose or draw , is backed up to the starting node
