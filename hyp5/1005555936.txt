the initial presentation of mrsa is small red bumps that resemble pimples , spider bites , or boils ; they may be accompanied by fever and , occasionally , rashes ) diabetes intravenous drug users regular contact with someone who used drugs in the past year users of quinolone antibiotics elderly people school children sharing sports and other equipment college students living in dormitories people staying or working in a health-care facility for an extended period of time people who spend time in coastal waters where mrsa is present , such as some beaches in florida and the west coast of the united states people who spend time in confined spaces with other people , including occupants of homeless shelters , prison inmates , and military recruits in basic training veterinarians , livestock handlers , and pet owners people who ingest unpasteurized milk people who are immunocompromised and also colonized people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease people who have had thoracic surgery as many as 22 % of people infected with mrsa do not have any discernable risk factors . prison inmates and military personnel in the news media , hundreds of reports of mrsa outbreaks in prisons appeared between 2000 and 2008 generally , animals are asymptomatic domestic pets are susceptible to mrsa infection by transmission from their owners ; conversely , mrsa-infected pets can also transmit mrsa to humans in october 2015 , new york giants tight end daniel fells was hospitalized with a serious mrsa infection parents should be especially cautious of children who participate in activities where sports equipment is shared , such as football helmets and uniforms owing to the size of the sccmec element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer , a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of mrsa infections , with clonal complex ( cc ) 8 most prevalent these distinctions were thoroughly investigated by collins et al meca encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a ( pbp2a ) , which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind methicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics sahebnasagh r , saderi h , owlia p blai and blar1 are homologous to meci and mecr1 , respectively , and normally function as regulators of blaz , which is responsible for penicillin resistance . arginine catabolic mobile element speg-positive acme compensates for the polyamine hypersensitivity of s these genetic variations within different mrsa strains possibly explain the variability in virulence and associated mrsa infections in the uk , the most common strains of mrsa are emrsa15 and emrsa16 this is further proven by molecular typing of ca-mrsa strains and genome comparison between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa , which indicate that novel mrsa strains integrated sccmec into mssa separately on its own by mid-2000 , ca-mrsa was introduced into healthcare systems and distinguishing ca-mrsa from ha-mrsa became a difficult process in the united states , most cases of ca-mrsa are caused by a cc8 strain designated st8 : usa300 , which carries sccmec type iv , panton–valentine leukocidin , psm-alpha and enterotoxins q and k , and st1 : usa400 and is becoming more common in canada after its first appearance there in 2004 in taiwan , st59 strains , some of which are resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics , have arisen as common causes of skin and soft tissue infections in the community in a remote region of alaska , unlike most of the continental u.s still , because no quick and easy method exists to diagnose mrsa , initial treatment of the infection is often based upon '' strong suspicion '' and techniques by the treating physician ; these include quantitative pcr procedures , which are employed in clinical laboratories for quickly detecting and identifying mrsa strains aureus to be resistant to oxacillin aureus is a gram-positive , spherical ( coccus ) bacterium about 1 micron in diameter it does not form spores and it is not motile other strains of s aureus has also developed resistance to vancomycin ( vrsa ) gisa , a strain of resistant s resistance to antibiotics in s the centers for disease control and prevention offers suggestions for preventing the contraction and spread of mrsa infection which are applicable to those in community settings , including incarcerated populations , childcare center employees , and athletes mathematical models describe one way in which a loss of infection control can occur after measures for screening and isolation seem to be effective for years , as happened in the uk care should be taken when trying to drain boils , as disruption of surrounding tissue can lead to larger infections , including sepsis in the united kingdom , the workplace ( health , safety and welfare ) regulations 1992 require businesses to provide toilets for their employees , along with washing facilities including soap or other suitable means of cleaning mrsa is established in animals and birds ceftaroline , a fifth-generation cephalosporin , is the first beta-lactam antibiotic approved in the us to treat mrsa infections in skin and soft tissue or community-acquired pneumonia moreover , the efficacy of vancomycin against mrsa is inferior to that of anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics against methicillin-susceptible s in surgical wounds , evidence is weak ( high risk of bias ) that linezolid may be better than vancomycin to eradicate mrsa ssis : diabetic ulcer , pressure ulcer , arterial insufficiency ulcer , venous ulcer ) for bacteremia and endocarditis , vancomycin or daptomycin is considered neonates can develop neonatal pustulosis as a result of topical infection with mrsa four to six weeks of antibiotic treatment is often recommended , and is dependent upon the extent of mrsa infection if the pneumonia is complicated by the accumulation of pus in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs , drainage may be done along with antibiotic therapy people with cystic fibrosis may develop respiratory complications related to mrsa infection septic thrombosis of cavernous or dural venous sinus can sometimes be a complication in some cases , the infection can be symptomatic and the pet can suffer a mrsa infection infections of surgical sites range from 1 % to 33 % globally , mrsa infection rates are dynamic and vary year to year european incidence was 22.8 % the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) estimated that about 1.7 & nbsp ; million nosocomial infections occurred in the united states in 2002 , with 99,000 associated deaths the estimated incidence is 4.5 nosocomial infections per 100 admissions , with direct costs ( at 2004 prices ) ranging from 10,500 ( £5300 , €8000 at 2006 rates ) per case ( for bloodstream , urinary tract , or respiratory infections in immunocompetent people ) to 111,000 ( £57,000 , €85,000 ) per case for antibiotic-resistant infections in the bloodstream in people with transplants in the united states , an estimated 95 & nbsp ; million people carry s aureus in their noses ; of these , 2.5 & nbsp ; million ( 2.6 % of carriers ) carry mrsa in a us cohort study of 1,300 healthy children , 2.4 % carried mrsa in their noses the rate had increased to 22 % by 1995 , and by 1997 the level of hospital s a report released by the university of chicago children 's hospital comparing two periods ( 1993–1995 and 1995–1997 ) found a 25-fold increase in the rate of hospitalizations due to mrsa among children in the united states several studies , however , including one by blot and colleagues , that have adjusted for underlying disease still found mrsa bacteremia to have a higher attributable mortality than methicillin-susceptible s aureus ( mssa ) bacteremia in a meta-analysis of 31 studies , cosgrove et al across europe , based mostly on data from 2013 , seven countries ( iceland , norway , sweden , the netherlands , denmark , finland , and estonia , from lowest to highest ) had low levels of hospital-acquired mrsa infections compared to the others , and among countries with higher levels , significant improvements had been made only in bulgaria , poland , and the british isles a report on skin and soft-tissue infections in the cook county jail in chicago in 2004–05 demonstrated mrsa was the most common cause of these infections among those incarcerated there lawsuits filed against those who are accused of infecting others with mrsa are also popular stories in the media mrsa is the topic of radio programs , television shows , books , and movies
