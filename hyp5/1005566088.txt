origins , sources and history carnatic music is based as it is today on musical concepts ( including swara , raga , and tala ) that were described in detail in several ancient works , particularly the bharata 's natya shastra and silappadhikaram by ilango adigal purandara dasa , who is known as the '' father ( pitamaha ) of carnatic music '' , formulated the system that is commonly used for the teaching of carnatic music in the 18th and 19th centuries , carnatic music was mainly patronised by the local kings of the kingdom of mysore , kingdom of travancore , and the thanjavur maratha kingdom with the dissolution of the erstwhile princely states and the indian independence movement reaching its conclusion in 1947 , carnatic music went through a radical shift in patronage into an art of the masses with ticketed performances organised by private institutions called sabhās the main emphasis in carnatic music is on vocal music ; most compositions are written to be sung , and even when played on instruments , they are meant to be performed in a singing style ( known as gāyaki ) while there are an infinite number of sounds falling within a scale ( or raga ) in carnatic music , the number that can be distinguished by auditory perception is twenty-two ( although over the years , several of them have converged ) there is a system known as the katapayadi sankhya to determine the names of melakarta ragas melakarta or parent ragas ) and janya ragas ( descendant ragas of a particular janaka raga ) niraval , usually performed by the more advanced performers , consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly , but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations although niraval consists of extempore melodic variations , generally , the original patterns of duration are maintained ; randel2003 , p562 each word in the lines of text stay set within their original place ( idam ) in the tala cycle nettlrussell1998 , p219 like niraval , nettlrussell1998 , p232 kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the raga of the melody and at a specific place ( idam ) in the tala cycle originally developed for the veena , it consists of expanding the raga with syllables like tha , nam , thom , aa , nom , na , etc ragam , tanam , and pallavi are the principal long form in concerts , and is a composite form of improvisation nearly every rendition of a carnatic music composition is different and unique as it embodies elements of the composer 's vision , as well as the musician 's interpretation forms such as the divya prabandha , thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly , however , these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama , javali , padam , thillana and thiruppugazh forms in carnatic music concerts , varnams are often performed by musicians as the opening item – acting as a warm up for the musicians , gupta2006 , p68 and as a means of grabbing the attention of the audience the final ( and longest ) verse that wraps up the song there can be multiple charanas still others have a verse at the end of the charana , called the madhyamakāla there are many composers in carnatic music he structured graded exercises known as swaravalis and alankaras , and at the same time , introduced the raga mayamalavagowla as the first scale to be learnt by beginners the contemporaries tyagaraja ( 1767– 1847 ) , muthuswami dikshitar , ( 1776–1835 ) and syama sastri , ( 1762–1827 ) are regarded as the trinity of carnatic music because of the quality of syama sastri 's compositions , the varieties of compositions of muthuswami dikshitar , and tyagaraja 's prolific output in composing kritis prominent composers prior to the trinity of carnatic music include sripadaraja , vyasatirtha , kanakadasa , vadiraja tirtha , arunachala kavi , annamacharya , narayana teertha , vijaya dasa , jagannatha dasa , gopala dasa , bhadrachala ramadas , sadasiva brahmendra and oottukkadu venkata kavi composers of carnatic music were often inspired by religious devotion and were usually scholars proficient in one or more of the languages kannada , malayalam , sanskrit , tamil , or telugu papanasam sivan , who has been hailed as the tamil tyagaraja of carnatic music , composed in tamil and sanskrit , and used the signature ramadasan in his compositions it typically takes several years of learning before a student is adept enough to perform at a concert written notation of carnatic music was revived in the late 17th century and early 18th century , which coincided with rule of shahaji ii in tanjore unlike classical western music , carnatic music is notated almost exclusively in tonic sol-fa notation using either a roman or indic script to represent the solfa names if the duration of note is to be doubled , the letter is either capitalized ( if using roman script ) or lengthened by a diacritic ( in indian languages ) thus , sā quadrupled in length would be denoted as '' s , , , '' each kriti sticks to one specific raga , although some are composed with more than one raga ; these are known as ragamalika ( a garland of ragas ) in very long strings of swara , the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga , have no awkward pauses or lapses in the beat of the song , and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow then the melodic accompaniment ( violin or veena ) , expounds the raga in this , the accompaniment ( usually violin , sometimes veena ) performs along with the main performer and the percussion ( such as a mridangam ) if multiple percussion instruments are employed , they engage in a rhythmic dialogue until the main performer picks up the melody once again some of the types of songs performed towards the end of the concerts are tillanas and thukkadas – bits of popular kritis or compositions requested by the audience as and when the artist exhibits creativity , the audience acknowledge it by clapping their hands with the city of chennai ( then known as madras ) emerging as the locus for carnatic music during the 19th century , its musicians founded the tyagaraja aradhana festival in 1846 some concert organisers also feature their own carnatic music festivals during the season thousands of performances are held by hundreds of musicians across various venues in the city kassebaum , gayatri rajapur ‘ karnatak raga ’ ( 2000 ) in nettl , b in viswanathan , t & cormack , jody ( 1998 )
