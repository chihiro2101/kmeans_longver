this system did not directly encode or transmit the rgb signals ; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure , called the '' luminance '' instead , the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots rca was included in this group ; on 5 february 1940 they demonstrated a system using three conventional tubes combined to form a single image on a plate of glass , but the image was too dim to be useful john logie baird , who made the first public color television broadcast using a semi-mechanical system on 4 february 1938 , was already making progress on an all-electronic version through the early 1950s , several major electronics companies started development of such systems paramount pictures worked long and hard on the chromatron , which used a set of wires behind the screen as a secondary '' gun '' , further focussing the beam and steering it towards the correct color lawrence , university of california/chromatic television laboratories ( original chromatron patent ) richard clapp et all , '' a new beam-indexing coor television display system '' , proceedings of the ire , september 1956 , p the apple tube re-emerged in the 1970s and had some success but it was rca 's success with the shadow mask that dampened most of these efforts abramson & sterling , p this required even more power in order to light up the resulting image and as the power was divided up among three of these much more powerful guns , the cost of implementation was much higher than for a similar b & w set wartime advances in electronics had opened up large swaths of high frequency transmission to practical use , and in 1948 the u.s at the time there were very few television sets in use in the united states , so the stakeholder groups quickly settled on the idea of using uhf for a new , incompatible , color format cbs color was introduced in 1950 this had not been an issue in 1948 when the first fcc meetings were held , but by 1953 the number of b & w sets had exploded ; there was no longer any way they could simply be abandoned the shadow mask is installed to the screen using metal pieces or a rail or frame that is fused to the funnel or the screen glass respectively , holding the shadow mask in tension to minimize warping ( if the mask is flat , used in flat screen crt computer monitors ) and allowing for higher image brightness and contrast . improvements , market acceptance doming problems due to thermal expansion of the shadow mask were solved in several ways these materials suffered from easy magnetization that can affect the colors , but this could be generally solved by including an automatic demagnetizing feature the frame was then welded to the inside of the tube better focusing systems , especially automatic systems that meant the set spent more time closer to perfect focus , allowed the dots to grow larger on the screen jerry whitaker , '' dtv handbook '' , mcgraw-hill , 2001 , p light from the phosphors was attenuated only once in manufacturing color crts , the shadow masks or aperture grilles were also used to expose photoresist on the faceplate to ultraviolet light sources , accurately positioned to simulate arriving electrons for one color at a time ( the shadow mask or aperture grille had to be removable and accurately re-positionable for this process to succeed what is a shadow mask ?
