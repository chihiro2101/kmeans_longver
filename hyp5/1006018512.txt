in 1925 , ronald fisher advanced the idea of statistical hypothesis testing , which he called '' tests of significance '' , in his publication statistical methods for research workers in a 1933 paper , jerzy neyman and egon pearson called this cutoff the significance level , which they named \alpha they recommended that \alpha be set ahead of time , prior to any data collection this means that \alpha is also the probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis , if the null hypothesis is true this is also called false positive and type i error for example , when \alpha is set to 5 % , the conditional probability of a type i error , given that the null hypothesis is true , is 5 % , and a statistically significant result is one where the observed p-value is less than ( or equal to ) 5 % there is also a difference between statistical significance and practical significance overuse in some journals in social psychology , the journal basic and applied social psychology banned the use of significance testing altogether from papers it published , requiring authors to use other measures to evaluate hypotheses and impact in 2016 , the american statistical association ( asa ) published a statement on p-values , saying that '' the widespread use of 'statistical significance ' ( generally interpreted as p & nbsp ; ≤ 0.05 ' ) as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding ( or implied truth ) leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process '' 4 ( october 2019 ) , pp & nbsp ; 62–67 some researchers suggest changing statistical methods , whereas others would do away with a threshold for defining '' significant '' results ann arbor , university of michigan press , 2009 the earth is round ( p < vol 49 , p '' the concept of statistical significance testing '' ( february 1994 ) : article by bruce thompon hosted by the eric clearinghouse on assessment and evaluation , washington , d.c
