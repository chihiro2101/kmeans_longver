unlike the natural porphyrin ligands , oep 2− is highly symmetrical file : h2tpp.png tetraphenylporphyrin ( h 2 tpp ) is another synthetic analogue of protoporphyrin ix porphyrins are the conjugate acids of ligands that bind metals to form complexes heme-containing proteins , or hemoproteins , are found extensively in nature a benzoporphyrin is a porphyrin with a benzene ring fused to one of the pyrrole units they can occur in crude oil , oil shale , coal , or sedimentary rocks vogel and coworkers reported successful isolation of 18porphyrin- ( 3.0.1.0 ) or isoporphycene pdt is considered a noninvasive cancer treatment , involving the interaction between light of a determined frequency , a photo-sensitizer , and oxygen and kessel , d ( 2009 ) , a role for hydrogen peroxide in the pro‐apoptotic effects of photodynamic therapy photochemistry and photobiology , 85 : 1491-1496 , & drain , c while excess production of porphyrins indicate organochlorine exposure , lead inhibits ala dehydratase enzyme metalloporphyrins are also studied as catalysts for water splitting , with the purpose of generating molecular hydrogen and oxygen for fuel cells . molecular electronics and sensors metalloporphyrins have been investigated as sensors theoretical interest in aromaticity
