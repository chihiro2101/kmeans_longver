they can be classified by their characteristics ( so-called international romanization systems for cyrillic text are based on central-european alphabets like the czech and croatian alphabet if the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script , the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script , with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader 's language romanization standards include the following : deutsche morgenländische gesellschaft ( 1936 ) : adopted by the international convention of orientalist scholars in rome qalam ( 1985 ) : a system that focuses upon preserving the spelling , rather than the pronunciation , and uses mixed case iso 233-2 ( 1993 ) : simplified transliteration iso/dis 259-3 : phonemic transcription indic ( brahmic ) scripts see also transliteration of indic scripts : how to use iso 15919 however , in practice the situation is , in pakistan : standard ( saaf or khaalis ) urdu is the '' high '' variety , whereas hindustani is the '' low '' variety used by the masses ( called urdu , written in nastaʿlīq script ) one of primary stated objectives of hamari boli is to relieve hindustani of the crippling devanagari–nastaʿlīq digraphia by way of romanization predecessor of hanyu pinyin hanyu pinyin ( 1958 ) : in mainland china , hanyu pinyin has been used officially to romanize mandarin for decades , primarily as a linguistic tool for teaching the standardized language the system is also used in other chinese-speaking areas such as singapore and parts of taiwan , and has been adopted by much of the international community as a standard for writing chinese words and names in the latin script min nan or hokkien romanization ( or , more generally , roman letters ) is called '' rōmaji '' in japanese also adopted as ( iso 3602 ) ala-lc : similar to modified hepburn wāpuro : ( '' word processor romanization '' ) transliteration not strictly a system , but a collection of common practices that enables input of japanese text while romanization has taken various and at times seemingly unstructured forms , some sets of rules do exist : mccune–reischauer ( mr ; 1937 ? ) , the first transcription to gain some acceptance a slightly changed version of mr was the official system for korean in south korea from 1984 to 2000 , and yet a different modification is still the official system in north korea what is called mr may in many cases be any of a number of systems that differ from each other and from the original mr mostly in whether word endings are separated from the stem by a space , a hyphen or & nbsp ; – according to mccune 's and reischauer 's system & nbsp ; – not at all ; and if a hyphen or space is used , whether sound change is reflected in a stem 's last and an ending 's first consonant letter ( e.g vowel length in old or dialectal pronunciation is indicated by a macron revised romanization of korean ( rr ; 2000 ) : includes rules both for transcription and for transliteration rr is generally similar to mr , but uses no diacritics or apostrophes , and uses distinct letters for ㅌ/ㄷ ( t/d ) , ㅋ/ㄱ ( k/g ) , ㅊ/ㅈ ( ch/j ) and ㅍ/ㅂ ( p/b ) while the spanish language itself uses a very phonemic spelling , the romanised spelling created for philippine languages is even more so thai , spoken in thailand and some areas of laos , burma and china , is written with thai alphabet , probably descended from mixture of tai–laotian and old khmer , in the brahmic family bgn/pcgn romanization of belarusian , 1979 ( united states board on geographic names and permanent committee on geographical names for british official use ) scientific transliteration , or the international scholarly system for linguistics ala-lc romanization , 1997 ( american library association and library of congress ) : iso 9:1995 instruction on transliteration of belarusian geographical names with letters of latin script , 2000 state gazette 19 , sofia , 13 march 2009 iso 9 ( 1995 ) : transliteration from the international organization for standardization xlii ( 2017 ) no comparative transliteration of russian in different languages ( western european , arabic , georgian , braille , morse ) the chart below shows the most common phonemic transcription romanization used for several different alphabets
