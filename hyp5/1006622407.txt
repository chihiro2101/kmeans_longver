a longer underpass containing a road , canal or railway is normally called a '' tunnel '' , whether or not it passes under another item of infrastructure rail station platforms may be connected by pedestrian tunnels or footbridges antiquity and early middle ages geotechnical investigation and design groundwater control is very important in tunnel construction hoboken , nj : john wiley & sons inc a square or rectangular excavation is more difficult to make self-supporting , because of a concentration of stress at the corners the 1934 queensway tunnel under the river mersey at liverpool was chosen over a massively high bridge for defense reasons ; it was feared that aircraft could destroy a bridge in times of war other reasons for choosing a tunnel instead of a bridge include avoiding difficulties with tides , weather , and shipping during construction ( as in the channel tunnel ) , aesthetic reasons ( preserving the above-ground view , landscape , and scenery ) , and also for weight capacity reasons ( it may be more feasible to build a tunnel than a sufficiently strong bridge ) civil engineers usually use project management techniques for developing a major structure the costs and benefits for an infrastructure such as a tunnel must be identified however , the port authority of new york and new jersey was not aware of this bill and had not asked for a grant for such a project cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a trench is excavated and roofed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel only a shallow excavation is needed to construct the tunnel roof using precast beams or in situ concrete sitting on the walls for intermediate levels , both methods are possible this construction form generally has two levels , which allows economical arrangements for ticket hall , station platforms , passenger access and emergency egress , ventilation and smoke control , staff rooms , and equipment rooms this contrasts with many traditional stations on london underground , where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access despite these difficulties , tbms are now preferred over the older method of tunnelling in compressed air , with an airlock/decompression chamber some way back from the tbm , which required operators to work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures at the end of their shifts , much like deep-sea divers the borehole has a diameter of a larger tbm was built to bore the green heart tunnel ( dutch : tunnel groene hart ) as part of the hsl-zuid in the netherlands , with a diameter of turning the tool manually , the kicker extracts a section of soil , which is then placed on the waste extract used in victorian civil engineering , the method found favor in the renewal of britain 's ancient sewerage systems , by not having to remove all property or infrastructure to create a small tunnel system the method was virtually silent and so not susceptible to listening methods of detection a temporary access shaft is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel they are usually circular and go straight down until they reach the level at which the tunnel is going to be built tunnels and shafts in rock washington , dc : department of the army the new austrian tunnelling method ( natm ) —also referred to as the sequential excavation method ( sem ) —was developed in the 1960s in pipe jacking , hydraulic jacks are used to push specially made pipes through the ground behind a tbm or shield in 1945 the delaware aqueduct tunnel was completed , supplying water to new york city in the us at it is the longest tunnel in the world the seikan tunnel in japan connects the main island of honshu with the northern island of hokkaido by rail it is long , of which are crossing the tsugaru strait undersea the channel tunnel crosses the english channel between france and the united kingdom the tunnel is long and at above sea level is the highest active railroad tunnel in the us ( the tennessee pass line , currently inactive , and alpine tunnel are higher ) four of the tunnels ( allegheny mountain , tuscarora mountain , kittatinny mountain , and blue mountain ) remain in active use , while the other three ( laurel hill , rays hill , and sideling hill ) were bypassed in the 1960s ; the latter two tunnels are on a bypassed section of the turnpike now commonly known as the abandoned pennsylvania turnpike the essingeleden was opened in 1966 , in stockholm , sweden , and the elbe tunnel ( 1975 ) opened in 1975 in hamburg , germany both tunnels handle around 150,000 vehicles a day , making them two of the most trafficked tunnels in the world the honningsvåg tunnel long ) opened in 1999 on european route e69 in norway as the world 's northernmost road tunnel , except for mines ( which exist on svalbard ) the fenghuoshan tunnel , completed in 2005 on the qinghai-tibet railway is the world 's highest railway tunnel , about above sea level and long the tunnel is subject to serious groundwater pressure smugglers use secret tunnels to transport or store contraband , such as illegal drugs and weapons several tunnels have been discovered by the border security forces across the line of control along the india-pakistan border , mainly to allow terrorists access to the indian territory of jammu and kashmir lava tubes are emptied lava conduits , formed during volcanic eruptions by flowing and cooling lava punarjani guha in kerala , india torghatten , a norwegian island with a hat-shaped silhouette , has a natural tunnel in the middle of the hat , letting light come through
