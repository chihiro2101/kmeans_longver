the book of water chapter describes musashi 's style , ni-ten ichi-ryu , or '' two heavens , one style '' it describes some basic technique and fundamental principles as if it were a straight road mapped out on the ground he writes , '' the bow is tactically strong at the commencement of battle , especially battles on a moor , as it is possible to shoot quickly from among the spearmen in all skills and abilities there is timing you must be able to discern this these rules are for his students , and are complemented by the 21 '' spiritual principles '' for all to follow , which are found in the dokkōdō ( musashi 's final work ) the principles are : '' do not think dishonestly '' '' the way is in training '' '' do nothing which is of no use the book of water the over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is discouraged by musashi , as it would be seen to reveal your spirituality to your enemy since small people know the spirituality of big people , they can thus note differences and weaknesses between each other in regards to the gaze of someone , he notes that a person must be able to perceive that which is all around him without moving their eyeballs noticeably , which is said to be a skill which takes an enormous amount of practice to perfect then his mind should adjust accordingly aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning , the technique is relatively simple to explain : if you are in a deadlock with the enemy , using the force from the cut , you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the void book to knock the enemy over '' fire and stone 's cut '' refers to when your swords clash together the book of fire it goes into a broader scope in terms of hints as to assess a situation , as well as specific situational instructions other disadvantages , such as forcing enemies into footholds , swamps , ditches , and other difficult terrain , force the enemy to be uncertain of his situation these things can not be clearly explained in words although it is not mentioned , musashi must have been well aware that this method would also be the most likely to have a higher death count than the others due to the sheer mass of enemies because more than one enemy could then attack a single soldier or trooper albeit very confusing , the idea of tai tai no sen is circumventing an ambush or quick attack from the enemy by taking the initiative and attacking in full force musashi admits himself that this is a difficult thing to explain the idea of timing , as with singular battles , is known as the most important part of attacking next to the skill of participants as there is collapse within an enemy , such as waning in his numbers , musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage whereas most of the information given in the previous books is useful in such a way that it could still be applicable today , this book is primarily concerned with the specific details about other strategies that existed at the time the broader lesson from this book is that an important part of understanding your own way is to understand the way of your opponent as precisely as possible although short , the void book lists , philosophically , the nature of both human knowledge and other things he notes that in this void , what can be comprehended are things which we do and see , such as the way of the warrior , martial arts , and ni ten ichi ryu '' in the void is virtue , and no evil '' in the above quote , musashi speaks of '' virtue and no evil '' '' void , as such , is also empty of the sense of self ( anatta ) , good and evil , wanting and non-wanting , and is the spiritual dynamic that forms the jumping off point to satori , enlightenment this method is combined with 'the strike of nonthought ' , in which you will always strike with true force by swinging your sword toward the ground when your opponent 's sword is about to drop blow like a spark from a stone at this point in time , you need to completely equip yourself into the action of striking with your sword , and strike whenever you may see an opening , whether it may be the legs , arms , or head autumn monkey 's body this is why you must always think of quickly getting your body close to the enemy body of lacquer and paste one must attempt to paste one 's body against the opponent 's without leaving any area in which the bodies are not touching .
