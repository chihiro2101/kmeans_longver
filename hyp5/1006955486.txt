this allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms ( laying the foundations of graph theory ) , eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them now , if every bridge has been traversed exactly once , it follows that , for each land mass ( except for the ones chosen for the start and finish ) , the number of bridges touching that land mass must be even ( half of them , in the particular traversal , will be traversed '' toward '' the landmass ; the other half , '' away '' from it ) euler 's argument shows that a necessary condition for the walk of the desired form is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree such a walk is called an eulerian circuit or an euler tour euler 's work was presented to the st in the history of mathematics , euler 's solution of the königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory and the first true proof in the theory of networks , a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics franklin , an aristotelian realist philosophy of mathematics , palgrave macmillan , basingstoke , 2014 , pp & nbsp ; 513–533 two others were later demolished and replaced by a modern highway the rivers are replaced with short bushes and the central island sports a stone tōrō contra costa college pregel – a google graphing tool named after this problem present day graph problem
