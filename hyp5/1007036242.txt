status of the irish plenipotentiaries '' éire-ireland 42.1 ( 2007 ) : 229-255 ronan fanning , éamon de valera ( 2016 ) ratification of the plenipotentiaries on 18 september lloyd george recalled that : on 29 september lloyd george reiterated to de valera that recognition of the irish republic was '' a recognition which no british government can accord '' , and he repeated his invitation for talks on '' ascertaining how the association of ireland with the community of nations known as the british empire may best be reconciled with irish national aspirations '' , to start in london on 11 october , which was tacitly accepted by the irish side three months had passed by with nothing agreed the ambiguous status of the plenipotentiaries was to have unforeseeable consequences within the nationalist movement when it divided over the treaty 's contents in 1921–22 days after the truce that ended the anglo-irish war , de valera met lloyd george in london four times in the week starting 14 july on the irish side , these members were always collins and griffith , while on the british side , austen chamberlain always attended , though the second british negotiator would vary from day to day the british would not , i think , have declared terrible and immediate war upon us '' if the treaty was not signed at once personal bitterness developed ; arthur griffith said of erskine childers : '' i will not reply to any damned englishman in this assembly '' , and cathal brugha reminded everyone that the position of michael collins in the ira was technically inferior to his macentee was among their leaders the british house of commons approved the treaty on 16 december 1921 by a vote of 401 to 58 therefore its approval of the treaty was not enough to satisfy the requirements of the treaty on 15 december , robert barton was questioned by kevin o'higgins about his notes on lloyd george 's statement about signing the agreement or facing a renewal of war : '' did mr lloyd george single mr barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say , 'the man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war ? ' '' barton replied : '' what he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of every member of the delegation was necessary , or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the treaty '' i believe that that document was signed under duress and , though i have a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out , i have no hesitation in saying that i would not regard it as binding on the irish nation '' secret debates , 16 dec 1921 ; de valera the crucial private dáil session on 6 january was informed that it could not be told about a private conference of nine tds that had reached a compromise agreement on almost all points the night before griffith , as president of the dáil , worked with michael collins , who chaired the new provisional government of the irish free state , theoretically answerable to the house of commons of southern ireland , as the treaty laid down on 25 october 1922 , a new irish constitution was enacted by the third dáil , sitting as a constituent assembly ; the british parliament confirmed the enactment on 5 december 1922 definitions of their understanding of their mandate in 1918 and 1921 , and of the republic itself , are interspersed with the practicalities of devolving power from london to dublin the narrow division led to the outbreak of the irish civil war on 28 june 1922 in 1922 , its two main irish signatories , arthur griffith and michael collins , both died the treaty 's provisions relating to the monarch , the governor-general , and the treaty 's own superiority in law were all deleted from the constitution of the irish free state in 1932 , following the enactment of the statute of westminster by the british parliament even de valera 's proposals made in secret during the treaty debates differed very little in essential matters from the accepted text , and were far short of the autonomous 32-county republic that he publicly claimed to pursue
