: between initial xe and final 6s 2 electronic shells the lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 ( lanthanum ) to 71 ( lutetium ) this convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality ; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places , as parts of the table 's sixth and seventh rows ( periods ) lutetium is a chemical element with the symbol lu and atomic number 71 the dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after , with urbain and von welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other ; the naming honor went to urbain as he published his results earlier like other lanthanides , lutetium is one of the elements that traditionally were included in the classification '' rare earths hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes the word tungsten comes from the swedish language tung sten directly translatable to heavy stone , though the name is volfram in swedish to distinguish it from scheelite , in swedish alternatively named tungsten a hard , rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined , tungsten is found naturally on earth only in chemical compounds the free element is remarkable for its robustness , especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non-alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon with an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion ( ppb ) , rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust it was named after the river rhine in europe hammond '' osmium '' , c iridium is the chemical element with atomic number 77 , and is represented by the symbol ir iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators for this reason the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the cretaceous–paleogene boundary gave rise to the alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66 & nbsp ; million years ago 24 april 2012 it is a dense , malleable , ductile , precious , gray-white transition metal it is one of the rarest elements in the earth 's crust and has an average abundance of approximately 5 & nbsp ; μg/kg it occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits , mostly in south africa , which accounts for 80 % of the world production in europe , most countries left the gold standard with the start of world war i in 1914 and , with huge war debts , failed to return to gold as a medium of exchange its high malleability , ductility , resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions , and conductivity of electricity led to many uses of gold , including electric wiring , colored-glass production and even gold leaf eating it is also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum ( mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar ( mercuric sulfide ) mercury poisoning can also result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury ( such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury ) , inhalation of mercury vapor , or eating seafood contaminated with mercury it is used in lighting : electricity passed through mercury vapor in a phosphor tube produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor to fluoresce , making visible light metallic lead has a bluish-white color after being freshly cut , but it soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air lead poisoning has been documented from ancient rome , ancient greece , and ancient china elemental bismuth may occur naturally uncombined , although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores or german words weisse masse or wismuth meaningwhite mass a rare and highly radioactive element , polonium is chemically similar to bismuth and tellurium , and it occurs in uraniumores as it is unstable , all isotopes of polonium are radioactive astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol at and atomic number 85 the second longest-living astatine-211 is the only one to find a commercial use , being useful as an alpha decay in medicine ; however , only extremely small quantities are used , and in larger ones it is very hazardous , as it is intensely radioactive astatine was first produced by dale r corson , kenneth ross mackenzie , and emilio segrè in the university of california , berkeley in 1940 among astatine isotopes , six ( with mass numbers 214 to 219 ) are present in nature as the result of decay of heavier elements ; however , the most stable astatine-210 and the industrially used astatine-211 are not radon is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions intense radioactivity also hindered chemical studies of radon and only a few compounds are known radon is formed as part of the normal radioactive decay chain of uranium and thorium public health service , in collaboration with u.s environmental protection agency , december 1990 epidemiological studies have shown a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer while radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer , it is the number one cause among non-smokers , according to epa estimates
