authentication and authorization are defined in rfc 2865 while accounting is described by rfc 2866 the credentials are passed to the nas device via the link-layer protocol—for example , point-to-point protocol ( ppp ) in the case of many dialup or dsl providers or posted in an https secure web form rfc 2865 remote authentication dial in user service ( radius ) this request includes access credentials , typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user modern radius servers can do this , or can refer to external sources—commonly sql , kerberos , ldap , or active directory servers—to verify the user 's credentials authorization attributes are conveyed to the nas stipulating terms of access to be granted finally , when the user 's network access is closed , the nas issues a final accounting stop record ( a radius accounting request packet containing an acct-status-type attribute with the value '' stop '' ) to the radius server , providing information on the final usage in terms of time , packets transferred , data transferred , reason for disconnect and other information related to the user 's network access this is known as postfix notation for the realm realms can also be compounded using both prefix and postfix notation , to allow for complicated roaming scenarios ; for example , somedomain.com\username anotherdomain.com could be a valid username with two realms in that specification , the 'realm ' portion is required to be a domain name however , this practice is not always followed hence , the trust factor among the proxies gains more significance under such inter-domain applications proxy chains are explained in rfc:2607 radius codes ( decimal ) are assigned as follows :
