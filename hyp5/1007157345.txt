screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology one or more of these steps may , but not necessarily , involve computer-aided drug design in some countries , such as the united states , they are regulated at the national level by a single agency depending upon the jurisdiction , drugs may be divided into over-the-counter drugs ( otc ) which may be available without special restrictions , and prescription drugs , which must be prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner in accordance

government , and the representatives of the pharmaceutical industry brands , the association of the british pharmaceutical industry ( abpi ) furthermore , '' the international therapeutic class comparison test is responsible for comparing the national average transaction price of the patented drug product under review '' different countries that the prices are being compared to are the following : france , germany , italy , sweden , switzerland , the united kingdom , and the united states in india , drug prices are regulated by the national pharmaceutical pricing authority despite the enormous advances in science and technology , the number of new blockbuster drugs approved per billion dollars spent has halved every 9 years since 1950 to drop from 0.2 % each year to 0.05 % by
