then , a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur collapses , commonly incorrectly labeled as sinkholes also occur due to human activity , such as the collapse of abandoned mines and salt cavern storage in salt domes in places like louisiana , mississippi and texas new sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas '' human activities can accelerate collapses of karst sinkholes , causing collapse within a few years that would normally evolve over thousands of years under natural conditions flowing water in karst conduits carries the soil away , preventing soil from accumulating in rock cavities and allowing the collapse process to continue many human-induced sinkholes occur where natural diffused recharge is disturbed and surface water becomes concentrated in 2015 , the u.s their formation is facilitated by high groundwater flow , often caused by high rainfall ; such rainfall causes formation of the giant sinkholes in the nakanaï mountains , on the new britain island in papua new guinea in such conditions , the largest known sinkholes of the world have formed , like the deep xiaozhai tiankeng ( chongqing , china ) , giant sótanos in querétaro and san luis potosí states in mexico and others this has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the world—zacatón—but also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes , leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids sinkholes can be formed in retention ponds from large amounts of rain the maya civilization sometimes used sinkholes in the yucatán peninsula ( known as cenotes ) as places to deposit precious items and human sacrifices some of the most spectacular are the zacatón cenote in mexico ( the world 's deepest water-filled sinkhole ) , the boesmansgat sinkhole in south africa , sarisariñama tepuy in venezuela , the sótano del barro in mexico , and in the town of mount gambier , south australia sinkholes that form in coral reefs and islands that collapse to enormous depths are known as blue holes and often become popular diving spots some examples of such names are listed below metabolism in the layer of microorganisms causes heating of the water tiankengs – these are extremely large sinkholes , typically deeper and wider than , with mostly vertical walls , most often created by the collapse of caverns it swallowed a three-story building and a house ; it measured approximately wide and deep it includes an archway leading out to the red sea at , which has been the site for many freediving and scuba attempts , the latter often fatal lake kashiba – zambia its dimensions are about 150 m ( 490 f ) in diameter with a maximum depth of 70 & nbsp ; m ( 230 & nbsp ; ft ) xiaozhai tiankeng – chongqing municipality , china double nested sinkhole with vertical walls , deep dean 's blue hole – bahamas spectacular , round sinkhole , deep pozzo del merro , near rome , italy padirac cave – france four scuba divers are known to have died in it cave of swallows – san luis potosí sima de las cotorras – chiapas deep , with nearly vertical walls about 25 acres in area and deep daisetta sinkholes – daisetta , texas twelve springs , some more visible than others , feed a pond at the bottom approximately by and deep winter park sinkhole , in central florida , appeared 8 may 1981 it is now known as lake rose deepest sinkhole is deep ( from lowest rim within canyon ) ; total depth
