moreover , the egr valve was controlled , in part , by vacuum drawn from the carburetor venturi , which allowed more precise constraint of egr flow to only those engine load conditions under which is likely to form in internally funded research , they determined that egr can improve the fuel consumption of both direct-injected and port-injected gasoline engines by reducing pumping losses , mitigating knock , cooling the exhaust and eliminating the need for fuel enrichment this effect is minor compared to the first two uncooled egr designs do however exist , often referred to as hot gas recirculation ( hgr ) exhaust gas—largely nitrogen , carbon dioxide , and water vapor—has a higher specific heat than air , so it still serves to lower peak combustion temperatures egr also tends to reduce the amount of fuel burned in the power stroke the normally '' dry '' intake system of a diesel engine is now subject to fouling from soot , unburned fuel and oil in the egr bleed , which has little effect on airflow medium/heavy duty truck engines , fuel & computerized management systems 2nd edition , page : 206 though engine manufacturers have refused to release details of the effect of egr on fuel economy , the epa regulations of 2002 that led to the introduction of cooled egr were associated with a 3 % drop in engine efficiency , bucking a trend of a 5 % a year increase heywood , john b van basshuysen , richard , and schäfer , fred , '' internal combustion engine handbook , '' sae international , 2004
