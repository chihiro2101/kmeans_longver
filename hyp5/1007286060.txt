formal methods can be used at a number of levels : level 0 : formal specification may be undertaken and then a program developed from this informally proponents of such methods rely on the well-understood nature of domains to give meaning to the system ; critics point out that not every system may be intuitively or naturally viewed as a function proponents note the connection to classical logic ; critics note that such semantics never really describe what a system does ( merely what is true before and afterwards ) daniel jackson and jeannette wing , '' lightweight formal methods '' , ieee computer , april 1996 vinu george and rayford vaughn , '' application of lightweight formal methods in requirement engineering '' , crosstalk : the journal of defense software engineering , january 2003 they contend that the expressiveness of the languages involved , as well as the complexity of the systems being modelled , make full formalization a difficult and expensive task sten agerholm and peter g communications of the acm , 7 ( 12 ) :735–736 automated techniques fall into three general categories : automated theorem proving , in which a system attempts to produce a formal proof from scratch , given a description of the system , a set of logical axioms , and a set of inference rules some modern model checking tools produce a '' proof log '' detailing each step in their proof , making it possible to perform , given suitable tools , independent verification no false negatives are returned computer languages , systems and structures volume 37 ( 1 ) , pp to get fast convergence intel uses such methods to verify its hardware and firmware ( permanent software programmed into a read-only memory ) there are several other projects of nasa in which formal methods are applied , such as next generation air transportation system , unmanned aircraft system integration in national airspace system , gheorghe , a , & ancel , e and airborne coordinated conflict resolution and detection ( accord ) grundy , “ verified optimizations for the intel ia-64 architecture ” , in theorem proving in higher order logics , springer berlin heidelberg , 2004 , pp , % 20cav % 202008 ( lncs5123 , % 20springer , % 202008 ) ( isbn % 209783540705437 ) ( 573s ) _csln_.pdf page 449 functional verification of power gated designs by compositional reasoning ” , computer aided verification , springer berlin heidelberg , pp for concurrent software and systems , petri nets , process algebra , and finite state machines ( which are based on automata theory - see also virtual finite state machine or event driven finite state machine ) allow executable software specification and can be used to build up and validate application behaviour another approach to formal methods in software development is to write a specification in some form of logic—usually a variation of first-order logic ( fol ) —and then to directly execute the logic as though it were a program abstract interpretation automated theorem proving design by contract formal methods people formal specification formal verification formal system model checking software engineering specification language hinchey , formal methods hubert garavel ( editor ) and susanne graf hinchey , jonathan p jean françois monin and michael g
