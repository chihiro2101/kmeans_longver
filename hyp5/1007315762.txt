matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars , galaxy and other astronomical objects , leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is '' flat '' , meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe , except for local gravity the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered : the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10 23 & nbsp ; km , or 10 & nbsp ; billion light years outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field , there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays species of lichen carried on the esa biopan facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007 seeds of arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years it is located at an altitude of around more specifically , exposed bodily liquids such as saliva , tears , and liquids in the lungs boil away the crew altitude protection suit ( caps ) , a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts , prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kpa this pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism , but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and air embolism if not managed humans evolved for life in earth gravity , and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health this can cause nausea and vomiting , vertigo , headaches , lethargy , and overall malaise longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton , or spaceflight osteopenia these effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise during long-duration space travel , radiation can pose an acute health hazard exposure to high-energy , ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue , nausea , vomiting , as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count the inner boundary is the ionosphere on the night side , the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 earth radii deep space is defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind , a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere ( the heliosphere ) for billions of kilometers into space the heliopause in turn deflects away low-energy galactic cosmic rays , with this modulation effect peaking during solar maximum there are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter , saturn , mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably : the average is around 10 6 particles per m 3 , but cold molecular clouds can hold 10 8 –10 12 per m 3 the tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies this material is called the intergalactic medium ( igm ) as gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids , it heats up to temperatures of 10 5 & nbsp ; k to 10 7 & nbsp ; k , which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei ; this is why the igm is ionized when gas falls from the filamentary structures of the whim into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments , it can heat up even more , reaching temperatures of 10 8 & nbsp ; k and above in the so-called intracluster medium ( icm ) there is no clear boundary between earth 's atmosphere and space , as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases there are several standard boundary designations , namely : the fédération aéronautique internationale has established the kármán line at an altitude of as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics nasa 's space shuttle used 400,000 feet , as its re-entry altitude ( termed the entry interface ) , which roughly marks the boundary where atmospheric drag becomes noticeable , thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces an additional 25 states signed the treaty , without ratifying it of these , more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space the 1979 moon treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies ( including the orbits around such bodies ) over to the international community in 1976 , eight equatorial states ( ecuador , colombia , brazil , congo , zaire , uganda , kenya , and indonesia ) met in bogotá , colombia these claims are not internationally accepted . discovery , exploration and applications this concept built upon a 5th-century bce ontology argument by the greek philosopher parmenides , who denied the possible existence of a void in space the surviving books of the hsüan yeh school said that the heavens were boundless , '' empty and void of substance '' in 1640 , he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum he believed that the universe , while not infinite , could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained he extended the copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite universe filled with a substance he called aether , which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies it was replaced by albert einstein 's theory of special relativity , which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant , independent of the observer 's motion or frame of reference but the scale of the universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the german astronomer friedrich bessel using the estimated radiation of the background stars , he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6 & nbsp ; k it was later popularized in the writings of h the shorter term space is older , first used to mean the region beyond earth 's sky in john milton 's paradise lost in 1667 in 1935 , the u.s explorer ii crewed balloon flight reached an altitude of this was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961 , when yuri gagarin was sent into orbit on vostok 1 apollo 8 , which achieved lunar orbit and reached a maximum distance of from the earth the first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of venus by mariner 2 likewise , a site like the daedalus crater on the far side of the moon could shield a radio telescope from the electromagnetic interference that hampers earth-based observations the latter role serves a wide variety of purposes , including tracking soil moisture for agriculture , prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs , detection of diseases in plants and trees , and surveillance of military activities with these new rockets the cost to send materials into space remains prohibitively high for many industries other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails , ramjets , and beam-powered propulsion
