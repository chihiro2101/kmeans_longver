. following the start of nazi leader adolf hitler 's anti-jewish campaigns in 1933 , gold and his family left germany because of his father 's heritage the family travelled through europe for the next few years after graduating with a pass ( ordinary ) degree in june 1942 , gold worked briefly as an agricultural labourer and lumberjack in northern england before joining bondi and fred hoyle on naval research into radar ground clutter near dunsfold , surrey this led the three to all start questioning the big bang theory originally proposed by georges lemaître in 1931 and later advanced by george gamow , which suggested that the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today gold and bondi also stated that the issues with time scale that had plagued other cosmological theories – such as the discrepancy between the age of the universe as calculated by hubble and dating of radioactive decay in terrestrial rocks – were absent for the steady-state theory while there , gold attracted some controversy by suggesting that the interaction between charged particles from the sun with the earth 's magnetic field in creating magnetic storms in the upper atmosphere was an example of a collisionless shock wave gold resigned from the royal observatory following spencer-jones 's retirement and moved to the united states in 1956 , where he served as professor of astronomy ( 1957–1958 ) and robert wheeler wilson professor of applied astronomy ( 1958–1959 ) at harvard university in early 1959 , he accepted an appointment at cornell university , which had offered him the opportunity to set up an interdisciplinary unit for radiophysics and space research , and take charge of the department of astronomy . gold initially suggested that astronauts would sink into the dust , but upon later analysis of impact craters and electrostatic fields , he determined that the astronauts ' boots would sink only three centimeters into the moon 's surface apollo lunar surface closeup camera ( alscc ) image catalog , apollo image atlas , lunar and planetary institute in the 1970s and 1980s , gold was a vocal critic of nasa 's space shuttle program , deriding claims that the agency could fly 50 missions a year or that it could have low budget costs gold ignored the warning and testified before a congressional committee headed by senator walter mondale fletcher , george low wrote that '' gold should realize that being funded by the government and nasa is a privilege , and that it would make little sense for us to fund him as long as his views are what they are now '' i would then have to go to washington , discuss it with them and i then would get a certain fraction of it resurrected for several years running this happened , and then eventually it fizzled permanently , and i 've not tried to get any money out of nasa since . i was certainly regarded as persona non grata with nasa after that i had a very hard time . gold theorized that since petroleum and its component hydrocarbons were present across the entire universe , there was no reason to believe '' that on earth they must be biological in origin '' . gold proposed that fuels were trapped inside the core of the earth in randomized molecular form nearly 4.5 billion years ago he also pointed to the abundance of helium in oil and gas reserves as evidence for '' a deep source of the hydrocarbons '' after first publishing his views on abiogenic petroleum in 1979 , gold began finding the papers on the subject by soviet geologists and had them translated the announcement of gold 's findings was met with mixed reactions , ranging from '' furious incredulity '' to '' deep skepticism '' . gold disputed philp 's finding , believing that the oil and gas could have just as easily migrated up to the surface : '' they would have it that the oil and gas we found down there was from the five feet of sediments on the top – had seeped all the way down six kilometres down into the granite in 2019 , a study of gases and secondary carbonate minerals revealed that long-term microbial methanogenesis has occurred in situ deep within the fracture system of the crater ( for at least 80 million years ) and with an obvious spatial link to seep oils of surficial sedimentary origin , at odds with gold 's theories of deep abiotic gas migration in a 1992 paper , '' the deep , hot biosphere '' published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , gold first suggested that microbial life is widespread in the porosity of the crust of the earth , down to depths of several kilometers , where rising temperatures finally set a limit thomas gold , an astrophysicist at cornell university known for bold theorizing , has speculated that subterranean life may dot the cosmos , secluded beneath the surfaces of planets and moons and energized by geological processes , with no need for the warming radiation of nearby stars 'such life may be widely disseminated in the universe , ' he said , 'since planetary type bodies with similar subsurface conditions may be common as solitary objects in space , as well as in other solar-type systems throughout his academic career , gold received a number of honors and distinctions he was a fellow of the royal astronomical society ( 1948 ) , the royal society ( 1964 ) , the american geophysical union ( 1962 ) , the american academy of arts and sciences ( 1974 ) , and the american astronautical society , a member of the american philosophical society ( 1972 ) , the united states national academy of sciences ( 1974 ) and the international academy of astronautics , and an honorary fellow of trinity college , cambridge ( 1986 ) and the humboldt prize from the alexander von humboldt foundation in 1979 . gold did not earn a doctorate , but received an honorary doctor of science degree from cambridge university in 1969 . in his foreword to gold 's book the deep hot biosphere , theoretical physicist freeman dyson stated , '' gold 's theories are always original , always important , usually controversial – and usually right in the journal nature , hermann bondi wrote '' tommy gold will long be remembered as a singular scientist who stepped into any field where he thought an option was being overlooked he was also unusual in working mainly theoretically , but using little mathematics , relying instead on his profound intuitive understanding of physics controversy followed him everywhere his stature and influence were international gold married his first wife , merle eleanor tuberg , an american astrophysicist who had worked with subrahmanyan chandrasekhar , in cambridge in 1947 with her , he had a daughter lauren he was buried in the pleasant grove cemetery in ithaca . he was survived by his wife , four daughters , and six grandchildren
