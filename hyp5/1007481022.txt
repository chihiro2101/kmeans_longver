because of confusion between xml schema as a specific w3c specification , and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general , some parts of the user community referred to this language as wxs , an initialism for w3c xml schema , while others referred to it as xsd , an initialism for xml schema definition in its appendix of references , the xsd specification acknowledges the influence of dtds and other early xml schema efforts such as ddml , sox , xml-data , and xdr commerce one , inc the xsd 1.0 specification was originally published in 2001 , with a second edition following in 2004 to correct large numbers of errors '' xsi '' is the conventional prefix for the namespace '' xml schema documents usually have the filename extension '' attribute declarations , which define properties of attributes model group and attribute group definitions it allows new data types to be constructed from these primitives by three mechanisms : restriction ( reducing the set of permitted values ) , list ( allowing a sequence of values ) , and union ( allowing a choice of values from several types ) varieties of content model include : element-only content , in which no text may appear ( other than whitespace , or text enclosed by a child element ) simple content , in which text is allowed but child elements are not empty content , in which neither text nor child elements are allowed mixed content , which permits both elements and text to appear a complex type can be derived from another complex type by restriction ( disallowing some elements , attributes , or values that the base type permits ) or by extension ( allowing additional attributes and elements to appear ) after xml schema-based validation , it is possible to express an xml document 's structure and content in terms of the data model that was implicit during validation the schema can be used to generate human-readable documentation of an xml file structure ; this is especially useful where the authors have made use of the annotation elements although xml schema is successful in that it has been widely adopted and largely achieves what it set out to , it has been the subject of a great deal of severe criticism , perhaps more so than any other w3c recommendation schwartzbach presents '' problems with xml schema '' , rick jelliffe rick jelliffe critique in may 2009 , and david webber practical limitations of expressibility : xsd offers very weak support for unordered content content and attribute declarations can not depend on attributes or element context ( this was also listed as a central problem of dtd ) this point is amplified by uche ogbuji more on xml class warfare - o'reilly onlamp blog the two tasks of validation and augmentation ( adding type information and default values ) should be kept separate xsd 1.1 became a w3c recommendation in april 2012 , which means it is an approved w3c specification this proved controversial , and was therefore dropped from the specification at a late stage of development map xml schemas and owl-rdf/s ontologies .
