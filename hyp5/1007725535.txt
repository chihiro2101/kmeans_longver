it specifies which mechanisms are to be used for addressing stations over the transmission medium and for controlling the data exchanged between the originator and recipient machines in a network made up of people speaking , i.e it entails one of several methods : timing-based detection , character counting , byte stuffing , and bit stuffing the time-based approach expects a specified amount of time between frames a 0 , six 1 bits and a 0 ) the flags and the inserted 0 's are removed at the receiving end the services provided by the data link layer are : encapsulation of network layer data packets into frames frame synchronization in the logical link control ( llc ) sublayer : error control ( automatic repeat request , arq ) , in addition to arq provided by some transport-layer protocols , to forward error correction ( fec ) techniques provided on the physical layer , and to error-detection and packet canceling provided at all layers , including the network layer in the medium access control ( mac ) sublayer : multiple access methods for channel-access control , for example csma/cd protocols for collision detection and re-transmission in ethernet bus networks and hub networks , or the csma/ca protocol for collision avoidance in wireless networks error detection and correction when the receiver obtains a frame with an error detection code it recomputes it and verifies whether the received error detection code matches the computed error detection code adding up the resulting numbers yields 8 & nbsp ; + 5 & nbsp ; + 12 & nbsp ; + 12 & nbsp ; + 15 & nbsp ; 52 , and 5 & nbsp ; + 2 & nbsp ; 7 calculates the metadata though , if the receiver sees something like a '' 7 5 12 12 15 7 '' sequence ( first element altered by some error ) , it can run the check by calculating 7 & nbsp ; + 5 & nbsp ; + 12 & nbsp ; + 12 & nbsp ; + 15 & nbsp ; 51 and 5 & nbsp ; + 1 & nbsp ; 6 , and discard the received data as defective since 6 does not equal 7 the tcp/ip link layer has the operating scope of the link a host is connected to , and only concerns itself with hardware issues to the point of obtaining hardware ( mac ) addresses for locating hosts on the link and transmitting data frames onto the link in general , direct or strict comparisons of the osi and tcp/ip models should be avoided , because the layering in tcp/ip is not a principal design criterion and in general , considered to be '' harmful '' ( rfc 3439 )
