though coined earlier , the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber-optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators relationship to other fields photonics is closely related to optics the term electro-optics came into earlier use and specifically encompasses nonlinear electrical-optical interactions applied , e.g optomechanics , which involves the study of the interaction between light and mechanical vibrations of mesoscopic or macroscopic objects ; opto-atomics , in which devices integrate both photonic and atomic devices for applications such as precision timekeeping , navigation , and metrology ; plasmonics , which studies the interaction between light and plasmons in dielectric and metallic structures image : aphrodita aculeata ( sea mouse ) economically important applications for semiconductor photonic devices include optical data recording , fiber optic telecommunications , laser printing ( based on xerography ) , displays , and optical pumping of high-power lasers the potential applications of photonics are virtually unlimited and include chemical synthesis , medical diagnostics , on-chip data communication , sensors , laser defense , and fusion energy , to name several interesting additional examples consumer equipment : barcode scanner , printer , cd/dvd/blu-ray devices , remote control devices telecommunications : optical fiber communications , optical down converter to microwave medicine : correction of poor eyesight , laser surgery , surgical endoscopy , tattoo removal industrial manufacturing : the use of lasers for welding , drilling , cutting , and various methods of surface modification construction : laser leveling , laser rangefinding , smart structures aviation : photonic gyroscopes lacking mobile parts military : ir sensors , command and control , navigation , search and rescue , mine laying and detection entertainment : laser shows , beam effects , holographic art information processing sensors : lidar , sensors for consumer electronics metrology : time and frequency measurements , rangefinder photonic computing : clock distribution and communication between computers , printed circuit boards , or within optoelectronic integrated circuits ; in the future : quantum computer microphotonics and nanophotonics usually includes photonic crystals and solid state devices . overview of photonics research photonics commonly uses semiconductor-based light sources , such as light-emitting diodes ( leds ) , superluminescent diodes , and lasers characteristic for research on semiconductor light sources is the frequent use of iii-v semiconductors instead of the classical semiconductors like silicon and germanium examples for material systems used are gallium arsenide ( gaas ) and aluminium gallium arsenide ( algaas ) or other compound semiconductors optical amplifiers used in optical communications are erbium-doped fiber amplifiers , semiconductor optical amplifiers , raman amplifiers and optical parametric amplifiers another method is to take the light from a light source and modulate it in an external optical modulator with the increase in data center compute , the demands on data center networks correspondingly increase analog rf signal applications : using the ghz precision signal processing of photonic integrated circuits , radiofrequency ( rf ) signals can be manipulated with high fidelity to add or drop multiple channels of radio , spread across an ultra-broadband frequency range they can identify chemical or biochemical gases from air pollution , organic produce , and contaminants in the water
