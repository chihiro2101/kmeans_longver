the rad750 was released for purchase in 2001 the mars science laboratory ( curiosity ) , mars reconnaissance orbiter , and mars 2020 ( perseverance ) spacecraft have a rad750 on board the cpu itself can withstand 200,000 to 1,000,000 rads and temperature ranges between −55 and 125 & nbsp ; °c several ibook models and the last g3-based imac used this processor a cost reduced version of 750cxe , called 750cxr , is available at lower frequencies the 750fx ( code-named sahara ) came in 2002 and increased frequency up to 900 & nbsp ; mhz , the bus speed to 166 & nbsp ; mhz and the on-die l2 cache to 512 kib it also featured a number of improvements to the memory subsystem : an enhanced and faster ( 200 & nbsp ; mhz ) 60x bus controller , a wider l2 cache bus , and the ability to lock parts of the l2 cache it is manufactured using a 0.13 μm copper based fabrication with low-k and silicon on insulator technology flight computer originally built for boeing 's 787 jet airliner the 750gx has 44 million transistors , a die size of 52 & nbsp ; mm 2 and consumes less than 9 & nbsp ; w at 1 & nbsp ; ghz at typical loads it was reported to be finished and ready for production in december 2003 , but said timing was too late for it to get significant orders seeing apple 's ibook line had switched to g4s in october the same year , and thus it quickly fell off the roadmap ibm powerpc 750cl microprocessor revision level dd2.x ibm powerpc 750cl risc microprocessor user ’ s manual the cpu in wii u is believed to be an evolution of the broadway architecture however ibm did make the espresso processor for nintendo , which is a 750 based design with improvements such as multiprocessor support ( the part is a triple core ) , new 45 & nbsp ; nm fabrication process and edram instead of regular l2 cache ; it 's unknown if further changes were made to the design freescale has discontinued all 750 designs in favor of designs based on the powerpc e500 core ( powerquicc ) the pictures are illustrations and not to scale .
