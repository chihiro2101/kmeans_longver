glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 & nbsp ; residues per one molecule of glycogen glucose units are linked together linearly by α ( 1→4 ) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next in response to insulin levels being below normal ( when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range ) , glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis ( the breakdown of glycogen ) and gluconeogenesis ( the production of glucose from other sources ) as muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase , which is required to pass glucose into the blood , the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells this is in contrast to liver cells , which , on demand , readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs glycogen was discovered by claude bernard glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1 & nbsp ; phosphate : in vivo , phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100 the g6p & nbsp ; monomers produced have three possible fates : g6p can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel disorders of glycogen metabolism the most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes , in which , because of abnormal amounts of insulin , liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism , as well when experiencing glycogen debt , athletes often experience extreme fatigue to the point that it is difficult to move when athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise , their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly ; however , the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established .
