zygomycete spores can be formed through both sexual and asexual means before germination the spore is in a dormant state there are two types of dormancy they are formed in specialized structures , the mitosporangia ( sporangia ) that contain few to several thousand of spores , depending on the species in zygomycetes the formation of chlamydospores is usually intercalar once two opposite mating types have made initial contact , they give rise to a zygospore through multiple steps a septum develops by gradual inward extension until it separates the terminal gametangia from the progametangial base this can be seen as dark patches on the primary wall as the fusion septum dissolves type 1 is when the nuclei fuse quickly , within a few days , resulting in mature zygospore having haploid nuclei this results in diploid and haploid nuclei being found in the germ sporangium fungal hyphae grow at the tip the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the n-acetamido group in chitin these fibers are embedded in an amorphous matrix consisting of proteins , glucans ( which putatively cross-link the chitosan fibers ) , mannoproteins , lipids and other compounds . functions of trisporic acid in mucorales several cell wall modifications , as well as incorporation of sporopollenin ( responsible for the dark colour of spores ) take place resulting in a mature zygospore trisporic acid , as the endpoint of this recognition pathway , can solely be produced in presence of both compatible partners , which enzymatically produce trisporoid precursors to be further utilized by the potential sexual partner an example is the host-parasite interaction of a parasexual nature observed between parasitella parasitica , a facultative mycoparasite of zygomycetes , and absidia glauca for example , in pilobolus crystallinus light is responsible for the dispersal mechanism and the sporangiophores of phycomyces blakesleeanus grow towards light reactions to red light were also observed the two genes for the enzymes phytoene desaturase ( carb ) and the bifunctional phytoene synthase/carotene cyclase ( carra in phycomyces , carrp in mucor ) are responsible for synthesis of beta-carotene the formation of these sporangiophores work at different light fluences and therefore with specific photoreceptors it is equally widespread in both kingdoms statolites are required in both fungi and plants for the mechanism of gravity-sensing the zygomycota sporangiophores originate from specialized “ basal hyphae ” and pass through several distinctive developmental stages until the mature asexual spores are released in addition to the positive phototropism , the sporangiophores are directed by a negative gravitropic response into a position suitable for spore dispersal and distribution both responses are growth reactions i.e the bending is caused by differential growth on the respective opposite flanks of the sporangiophore , and influence each other they are often associated to the vaculoar transepts complex of apical lipid globules are also involved in gravipereception however , the rank ( i.e , phylum or subphylum ) these clades is in dispute ( 2016 ) with both possible phylum names some species of the order mucorales are able to grow under anaerobic conditions , while most of them require aerobic conditions growth of zygomycota in solid agar can produce low or very high fibrous colony that rapidly fills the entire petri dish growth of the gametangia commences after gametangia come in contact , and plasmogamy , or the fusion of the cytoplasm , occurs
