mount erebus is currently the most active volcano in antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the erebus hotspot the composition of the current eruptive products of erebus are anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on fang ridge—an eroded remnant of an early erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of erebus researchers spent more than three months during the 2007–08 field season installing an atypically dense array of seismometers around mount erebus to listen to waves of energy generated by small , controlled blasts from explosives they buried along its flanks and perimeter , and to record scattered seismic signals generated by lava lake eruptions and local ice quakes almost no chance exists of photosynthetic-based organics , or of animals in a food chain based on photosynthetic life , and no overlying soil to wash down into them they are dynamic systems that collapse and rebuild , but persist over decades it was , at the suggestion of p.r cashman , united states antarctic research program team member hesiod , theogony 116–124 mount erebus ' summit crater rim was first achieved by members of sir ernest shackleton 's party ; edgeworth david , douglas mawson , alistair mackay , jameson adams , eric marshall and phillip brocklehurst ( who did not reach the summit ) , in 1908 on january 19–20 , 1991 , charles j blackmer , an iron-worker for many years at mcmurdo station and the south pole , accomplished a solo ascent in about 17 hours completely unsupported , by snow mobile and on foot 31 the air new zealand flyover service , for the purposes of antarctic sightseeing , was operated with mcdonnell douglas dc-10 aircraft and began in february 1977 its final flight was on february 17 , 1980 file : ross island map usgs 250k.png topographic map of ross island ( 1:250,000 scale ) mount erebus is in the lower left file : mount erebus craters , ross island , antarctica ( aerial view , 18 december 2000 ) charles neider coleman peak erebus glacier erebus ice tongue ice tower ridge list of volcanoes in antarctica lower erebus hut – home of mevo volcanic seven summits volcanic seven second summits helo cliffs , a prominent feature on the caldera
