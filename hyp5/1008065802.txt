when nagel 's original advisor , prof the real popularity of spice started with spice2 2nd spice2 ref in 1975 ucb/erl m89/42 , university of california , berkeley , april 1989 was developed by thomas quarles ( with a it is written in c , uses the same netlist syntax , and added x window system plotting developed by professor ronald rohrer of u.c i for one thank him for his vision the license originally included distribution restrictions for countries not considered friendly to the us , but the source code is currently covered by the bsd license pederson solid-state circuits award , ieee solid-state circuits society , june 2018 no newer versions of berkeley spice have been released after version 3f.5 in 1993 since then , the open-source or academic continuations of spice include : xspice , code-level modeling in xspice , f vogt , fosdem , brussels 2019 the most prominent commercial versions of spice include hspice ( originally commercialized by ashawna hailey of meta software , but now owned by synopsys ) and pspice ( now owned by cadence design systems ) program features and structure spice became popular because it contained the analyses and models needed to design integrated circuits of the time , and was robust enough and fast enough to be practical to use , is it time for spice4 ? , 2004 numerical aspects of device and circuit modeling workshop , june 23â€“25 , 2004 , santa fe , new mexico retrieved on 2007-11-10 precursors to spice often had a single purpose : the bias program , for example , did simulation of bipolar transistor circuit operating points ; the slic program did only small-signal analyses spice combined operating point solutions , transient analysis , and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits spice2 includes these analyses : ac analysis ( linear small-signal frequency domain analysis ) dc analysis ( nonlinear quiescent point calculation ) dc transfer curve analysis ( a sequence of nonlinear operating points calculated while sweeping an input voltage or current , or a circuit parameter ) noise analysis ( a small signal analysis done using an adjoint matrix technique which sums uncorrelated noise currents at a chosen output point ) transfer function analysis ( a small-signal input/output gain and impedance calculation ) transient analysis ( time-domain large-signal solution of nonlinear differential algebraic equations ) since spice is generally used to model nonlinear circuits , the small signal analyses are necessarily preceded by a quiescent point calculation at which the circuit is linearized other circuit simulators have since added many analyses beyond those in spice2 to address changing industry requirements at the circuit-level modeling , a photonic integrated circuit ( pic ) contain both electrical wires and optical signals , respectively described by voltage/current and by complex-valued envelope for the forward- and backward-propagating modes initial conditions for transient analysis for these circuits , either the feedback loop must be broken so that a dc operating point can be calculated or the initial conditions must be provided in the simulation input if uic is included in the if a node is set to 5 v in a . tran 1ns 100ns uic
