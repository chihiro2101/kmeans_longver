ultra-wideband was formerly known as pulse radio , but the fcc and the international telecommunication union radiocommunication sector ( itu-r ) currently define uwb as an antenna transmission for which emitted signal bandwidth exceeds the lesser of 500 & nbsp ; mhz or 20 % of the arithmetic center frequency pulse-uwb systems have been demonstrated at channel pulse rates in excess of 1.3 gigapulses per second using a continuous stream of uwb pulses ( continuous pulse uwb or c-uwb ) , supporting forward error correction encoded data rates in excess of 675 mbit/s with a cooperative symmetric two-way metering technique , distances can be measured to high resolution and accuracy international conference on ultra-wideband , 2008 apple launched the first three phones with ultra-wideband capabilities in september 2019 , namely , the iphone 11 , iphone 11 pro , and iphone 11 pro max samsung , xiaomi , oppo are currently members of the fira consortium arl has also investigated the feasibility of whether uwb radar technology can incorporate doppler processing to estimate the velocity of a moving target when the platform is stationary it serves as a potential alternative to continuous-wave radar since it involves less power consumption and a high-resolution range profile the work was completed by the wimedia alliance and the usb implementer forum federal communications commission ( fcc ) coexistence with other standards in february 2002 , the federal communication commission ( fcc ) released an amendment ( part 15 ) that speciÔ¨Åes the rules of uwb transmission / reception as a result , one would expect a degradation of the uwb bit error rate performance
