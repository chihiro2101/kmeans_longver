heat transfer is a process function ( or path function ) , as opposed to functions of state ; therefore , the amount of heat transferred in a thermodynamic process that changes the state of a system depends on how that process occurs , not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process steady state conduction is an idealized model of conduction that happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant , so that after a time , the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does not change any further ( see fourier 's law ) an example of steady state conduction is the heat flow through walls of a warm house on a cold day—inside the house is maintained at a high temperature and , outside , the temperature stays low , so the transfer of heat per unit time stays near a constant rate determined by the insulation in the wall and the spatial distribution of temperature in the walls will be approximately constant over time analysis of transient systems is more complex , and analytic solutions of the heat equation are only valid for idealized model systems another form of convection is forced convection bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations , such as ( for example ) between a solid surface and the fluid although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer , convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid ( diffusion ) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming the rayleigh number ( \rm ra ) is the product of the grashof ( \rm gr ) and prandtl ( \rm pr ) numbers convection occurs when the rayleigh number is above 1,000–2,000 since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles ( protons and electrons ) , their movement results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation , which carries energy away from the surface for radiative transfer between two objects , the equation is as follows : : \phi_q \epsilon \sigma f ( t_a^4 - t_b^4 ) , where \phi_q is the heat flux , \epsilon is the emissivity ( unity for a black body ) , \sigma is the stefan–boltzmann constant , f is the view factor between two surfaces a and b , and t_a and t_b are the absolute temperatures ( in kelvins or degrees rankine ) for the two objects ( t 4 -law lets the reverse-flow of radiation back to the source rise liquid – condensation and melting the liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy at standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures , no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms condensation in direct contact with subcooled liquid condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger : this is the most common mode used in industry : filmwise condensation is when a liquid film is formed on the subcooled surface , and usually occurs when the liquid wets the surface michael hogan ( 2011 ) sulfur , encyclopedia of earth , eds cleveland , national council for science and the environment , washington dc for small biot numbers , the approximation of spatially uniform temperature within the object can be used : it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself , due to the lower resistance to doing so , as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object thermal resistance is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow ( heat per time unit or thermal resistance ) to temperature difference good insulators are not necessarily good radiant barriers , and vice versa a material with a high reflectivity ( at a given wavelength ) has a low emissivity ( at that same wavelength ) , and vice versa vacuum flasks , or dewars , are silvered to approach this ideal fundamentals of classical thermodynamics , 3rd ed van wylen and r senf : '' heat engines are made to provide mechanical energy from thermal energy a thermoelectric cooler is a solid state electronic device that pumps ( transfers ) heat from one side of the device to the other when electric current is passed through it common types of heat exchangers include shell and tube , double pipe , extruded finned pipe , spiral fin pipe , u-tube , and stacked plate an energy audit can help to assess the implementation of recommended corrective procedures well-insulated parts of a building have a low thermal transmittance , whereas poorly-insulated parts of a building have a high thermal transmittance thermostat is a device to monitor and control temperature the greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases , and is re-radiated in all directions heat transfer in the human body convective heat transfer is driven by the movement of fluids over the surface of the body cengel , yunus a and ghajar , afshin j this concept explains why a person feels cold when not enough covering is worn when exposed to a cold environment clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to heat flow over the covered portion of the body the rate of evaporation heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid ; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces magnetic evaporative cooling is a process for lowering the temperature of a group of atoms , after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling thomas marshall christopher j thermal energy storage includes technologies for collecting and energy storage for later use it may be employed to balance energy demand between day and nighttime combined forced and natural convection heat capacity heat transfer physics stefan–boltzmann law thermal contact conductance thermal physics thermal resistance in electronics thermal science heat transfer enhancement
