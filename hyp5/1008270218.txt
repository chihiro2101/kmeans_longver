all members have the opportunity to present , and amend proposals better implementation : a process that includes and respects all parties , and generates as much agreement as possible sets the stage for greater cooperation in implementing the resulting decisions better group relationships : a cooperative , collaborative group atmosphere can foster greater group cohesion and interpersonal connection the level of agreement necessary to finalize a decision is known as a '' decision rule '' some common options may include the ability to : declare reservations : group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose '' declare reservations stand aside : a '' stand aside '' may be registered by a group member who has a '' serious personal disagreement '' with a proposal , but is willing to let the motion pass the basic model for achieving consensus as defined by any decision rule involves : collaboratively generating a proposal identifying unsatisfied concerns modifying the proposal to generate as much agreement as possible all attempts at achieving consensus begin with a good faith attempt at generating full-agreement , regardless of decision rule threshold if the debate fails to come to a verbal consensus , the referees draw up a final list of options - usually between 4 and 6 - to represent the debate the general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion identification and addressing of concerns : if consensus is not achieved , each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal , potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern modification of the proposal : the proposal is amended , re-phrased or ridered in an attempt to address the concerns of the decision-makers ideas and solutions belong to the group ; no names are recorded some groups allow '' blocking '' by even a single individual to halt or postpone the entire process key components of quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common humanity and the ability to decide together the goal is '' unity , not unanimity facilitators accept responsibility for moving through the agenda on time ; ensuring the group adheres to the mutually agreed-upon mechanics of the consensus process ; and , if necessary , suggesting alternate or additional discussion or decision-making techniques , such as go-arounds , break-out groups or role-playing consensor : the team of consensors is responsible for accepting those relevant proposals which conform with the un charter on human rights ; for displaying an initial list of these options ; for drawing up a balanced list of options to represent the entire debate ; to analyse the preferences cast in any subsequent mbc ballot ; and , if need be , to determine the composite decision from the two most popular options they work well with groups of fewer than 250 people and especially with multi-lingual groups one common set of hand signals is called the '' fist-to-five '' or '' fist-of-five '' critics of consensus blocking often observe that the option , while potentially effective for small groups of motivated or trained individuals with a sufficiently high degree of affinity , has a number of possible shortcomings , notably preservation of the status quo : in decision-making bodies that use formal consensus , the ability of individuals or small minorities to block agreement gives an enormous advantage to anyone who supports the existing state of affairs susceptibility to widespread disagreement : giving the right to block proposals to all group members may result in the group becoming hostage to an inflexible minority or individual channeling decisions away from an inclusive group process : when group members view the status quo as unjustly difficult to change through a whole group process , they may begin to delegate decision-making to smaller committees or to an executive committee available for free download in multiple formats at : it has disadvantages insofar as further disagreement , improvements or better ideas then remain hidden , but effectively ends the debate moving it to an implementation phase for detecting the illusion of unanimity symptom '' in consensus is not unanimity , consensus practitioner and activist leader starhawk wrote : confusion between unanimity and consensus , in other words , usually causes consensus decision-making to fail , and the group then either reverts to majority or supermajority rule or disbands some state clearly that unanimity is not consensus but rather evidence of intimidation , lack of imagination , lack of courage , failure to include all voices , or deliberate exclusion of the contrary views criticism of majority voting processes some proponents of consensus decision-making view procedures that use majority rule as undesirable for several reasons some advocates of consensus would assert that a majority decision reduces the commitment of each individual decision-maker to the decision in the abilene paradox , a group can unanimously agree on a course of action that no individual member of the group desires because no one individual is willing to go against the perceived will of the decision-making body since consensus decision-making focuses on discussion and seeks the input of all participants , it can be a time-consuming process anabaptists , including some mennonites , have a history of using consensus decision-making and some believe anabaptists practiced consensus as early as the martyrs ' synod of 1527 the global anabaptist mennonite encyclopedia references , in particular , acts 15 as an example of consensus in the new testament consensus voting was advocated , among others , by ram√≥n llull in 1199 , by nicholas cusanus in 1435 , by jean-charles de borda in 1784 , by hother hage in 1860 , by lewis carroll ( lewis carroll ) in 1884 , and by peter emerson in 1986 . ietf rough consensus model in 2001 , robert rocco cottone published a consensus-based model of professional decision-making for counselors and psychologists based on social constructivist philosophy , the model operates as a consensus-building model , as the clinician addresses ethical conflicts through a process of negotiating to consensus the united states bureau of land management 's policy is to seek to use collaborative stakeholder engagement as standard operating practice for natural resources projects , plans , and decision-making except under unusual conditions such as when constrained by law , regulation , or other mandates or when conventional processes are important for establishing new , or reaffirming existing , precedent a type of unanimous consent , the liberum veto originally allowed any member of a sejm to veto an individual law by shouting sisto activitatem !
