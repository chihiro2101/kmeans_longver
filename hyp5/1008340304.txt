lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times several species have appeared in the works of dioscorides , pliny the elder and theophrastus although the studies are not very deep during the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of spontaneous generation and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored lauder lindsay , william ( 1856 ) some of his more important works on the subject , which marked the beginning of lichenology as a discipline , are : lichenographiae suecia prodromus ( 1798 ) methodus lichenum ( 1803 ) lichenographia universalis ( 1810 ) synopsis methodica lichenum ( 1814 ) later lichenologists include the american scientists vernon ahmadjian and edward tuckerman and the russian evolutionary biologist konstantin merezhkovsky , as well as amateurs such as louisa collings these studies and classifications are the cornerstone of subsequent investigations a popular history of british lichens the apothecium reproductive organ being unique to fungi but absent in other photosynthetic organisms it was anton de bary a german mycologist who specialised in phytopathology who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the ascomycetes group by nostoc type algae and others successive studies such as those carried out by andrei famintsyn and baranetzky in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus in 1909 the russian lichenologist konstantin mereschkowski presented a research paper '' the theory of two plasms as the basis of symbiogenesis , a new study on the origin of organisms '' , which aims to explain a new theory of symbiogenesis by lichens and other organisms as evidenced by his earlier work '' nature and origin of chromatophores in the plant kingdom '' despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the swiss researcher eugen a thomas species : eugen a there appeared numerous renowned researchers within the field of lichenology henry nicollon des abbayes , william alfred weber , antonina georgievna borissova , irwin m miguel mateo garcia , the growth curve of rhizocarpon geographicum in the valley of madriu andorra , biophysical processes in cold media lichenometry relies upon the fact that the maximum diameter of the largest thallus of an epilithic lichen growing on a substrate is directly proportional to the time from first exposure of the area to the environment as seen in studies by roland beschel in 1950 and is especially useful in areas exposed for less than 1000 years growth is greatest in the first 20 to 100 years with 15–50 & nbsp ; mm growth per year and less in the following years with average growth of 2–4 & nbsp ; mm per year for example , david l with these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased ergosterol , usnic acid etc annals of the botanical garden of madrid ( 7 ) issn pp francisco javier toledo marante , ana garcia costellano , francisco leon oyola and jaime bermejo barrera '' ecologia quimica en hongos y liquenes '' ( spa ) columbian academy of science 28 issn 0370-3908 pp galloway ( jul 1988 ) '' lichenographia thompsoniana : north american lichenology in honour of john w thompson '' , m mitchell , matilda c
