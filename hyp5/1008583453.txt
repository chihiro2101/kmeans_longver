the most important arthropods that are involved in the process include carrion beetles , mites , the flesh-fly ( sarcophagidae ) and blow-fly ( calliphoridae ) , such as the lucilia ( fly ) seen in the summer aquatic and marine environments have break-down agents that include bacteria , fish , crustaceans , fly larvae and other carrion scavengers five general stages are used to describe the process of decomposition in vertebrate animals : fresh , bloat , active decay , advanced decay , and dry/remains for instance , if the person was flat on their back when they died , the blood would collect in the parts that are touching the ground these multiply , consuming the body 's carbohydrates , lipids , and proteins , to produce a variety of substances including propionic acid , lactic acid , methane , hydrogen sulfide , and ammonia in this stage , anaerobic metabolism takes place , leading to the accumulation of gases , such as hydrogen sulfide , carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrogen intestinal anaerobic bacteria transform haemoglobin into sulfhemoglobin and other colored pigments maggot activity , typically confined to natural orifices , and masses under the skin , causes the skin to slip , and hair to detach from the skin this loss occurs as a result of both the voracious feeding of maggots and the purging of decomposition fluids into the surrounding environment exposure to the elements a dead body that has been exposed to the open elements , such as water and air , will decompose more quickly and attract much more insect activity than a body that is buried or confined in special protective gear or artifacts colder temperatures decrease the rate of decomposition while warmer temperatures increase it under certain conditions ( normally cool , damp soil ) , bodies may undergo saponification and develop a waxy substance called adipocere , caused by the action of soil chemicals on the body 's proteins and fats the formation of adipocere slows decomposition by inhibiting the bacteria that cause putrefaction the bodies of newborns who never ingested food are an important exception to the normal process of decomposition anaerobic decomposition takes place in the absence of oxygen in sufficiently dry environments , an embalmed body may end up mummy and it is not uncommon for bodies to remain preserved to a viewable extent after decades padre pio , whose body was injected with formalin before burial in a dry vault from which he was later removed and placed on public display at the san giovanni rotondo the generally cool and anoxic conditions in these environments limits the rate of microbial activity , thus limiting the potential for decomposition even when a body is decomposed , embalming treatment can still be achieved ( the arterial system decays more slowly ) but would not restore a natural appearance without extensive reconstruction and cosmetic work , and is largely used to control the foul odors due to decomposition in some religious groups , this is known as incorruptibility . importance to forensic sciences forensic anthropology is the medico-legal branch of physical anthropology that studies skeletons and human remains , usually to seek clues as to the identity , age , sex , height and ethnicity of their former owner each frame is approximately 12 hours apart , as the fruit shrivels and becomes covered with mold in fact , decomposition contributes over 90 percent of carbon dioxide released each year spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi , which are borne by the animal itself , by the people handling the meat , and by their implements decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions soils which are rich in clay minerals tend to have lower decomposition rates , and thus , higher levels of organic matter soil disturbance like tillage increases decomposition by increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil and by exposing new organic matter to soil microbes compounds which are more resistant to decay , like lignin or cutin , are considered recalcitrant microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like chitin , and these also accumulate as the microbes die , further reducing the quality of older soil organic matter .
