the regions of higher friction along a fault plane , where it becomes locked , are called asperities slip , heave , throw slip is defined as the relative movement of geological features present on either side of a fault plane in practice , it is usually only possible to find the slip direction of faults , and an approximation of the heave and throw vector based on the direction of slip , faults can be categorized as : strike-slip , where the offset is predominantly horizontal , parallel to the fault trace ; dip-slip , offset is predominantly vertical and/or perpendicular to the fault trace ; or oblique-slip , combining strike and dip slip in a strike-slip fault ( also known as a wrench fault , tear fault or transcurrent fault ) , the fault surface ( plane ) is usually near vertical , and the footwall moves laterally either left or right with very little vertical motion transform faults are also referred to as '' conservative '' plate boundaries since the lithosphere is neither created nor destroyed a reverse fault is the opposite of a normal faultâ€”the hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall thrust faults typically form ramps , flats and fault-bend ( hanging wall and footwall ) folds nearly all faults have some component of both dip-slip and strike-slip ; hence , defining a fault as oblique requires both dip and strike components to be measurable and significant these faults may be accompanied by rollover anticlines ( e.g the niger delta structural style ) all faults have a measurable thickness , made up of deformed rock characteristic of the level in the crust where the faulting happened , of the rock types affected by the fault and of the presence and nature of any mineralising fluids the level of a fault 's activity can be critical for ( 1 ) locating buildings , tanks , and pipelines and ( 2 ) assessing the seismic shaking and tsunami hazard to infrastructure and people in the vicinity also , faults that have shown movement during the holocene plus pleistocene epochs ( the last 2.6 million years ) may receive consideration , especially for critical structures such as power plants , dams , hospitals , and schools many ore deposits lie on or are associated with faults further south in chile los bronces and el teniente porphyry copper deposit lie each at the intersection of two fault systems
