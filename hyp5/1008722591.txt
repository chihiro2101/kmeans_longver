this is derived as a noun form of the verb bokeru , which is written in several ways , with additional meanings and nuances : refers to being blurry , hazy or out-of-focus , whereas the and spellings refer to being mentally hazy , befuddled , childish , senile , or playing stupid the spellings bokeh and boke have both been in use since at least 1996 , when merklinger had suggested '' or bokeh if you prefer , more recently revived by meyer optik görlitz for conventional lens designs ( with bladed apertures ) , when a lens is stopped down smaller than its maximum aperture size ( minimum f-number ) , out-of-focus points are blurred into the polygonal shape formed by the aperture blades minolta has been on the forefront of promoting and introducing lenses with near-ideal circular apertures since 1987 , but most other manufacturers now offer lenses with shape-optimized diaphragms , at least for the domain of portraiture photography today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens , and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh in 2016 , apple inc released the iphone 7 plus which can take pictures with '' portrait mode '' ( a bokeh like effect ) both of these phones use dual cameras to detect edges and create a '' depth map '' of the image , which the phone uses to blur the out-of-focus portions of the photo image : dof-shallowdepthoffield.jpg an extremely shallow depth of field , a common effect in macrophotography , emphasizes bokeh image : bokeh example.jpg an example of the bokeh produced by the canon 85 mm prime f/1.8 lens image : donut bokeh.jpg catadioptric lens bokeh seen in more detail file : photography by victor albert grigas ( 1919-2017 ) 000172050002 ( 37159721864 ) unlike conventional convolution , this convolution has a kernel that depends on the distance of each image point and & nbsp ; – at least in principle & nbsp ; – has to include image points that are occluded by objects in the foreground to a first approximation , defocus blur is convolution by a uniform disk , a more computationally intensive operation than the '' standard '' gaussian blur ; the former produces sharp circles around highlights whereas the latter is a much softer effect diffraction may alter the effective shape of the blur , woo , g , hiura , s , smithwick , q , raskar , r
