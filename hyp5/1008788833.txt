prior to the actual construction of the navigation , there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme , and opposition from the port of maldon , which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to chelmsford the next schemes were proposed in 1762 , when the canal engineers john smeaton and thomas yeoman both carried out surveys for a possible route eventually , ferdinando and william stratford took on the task , but both caught ague and fever , from which ferdinando died , while william was ill for a year but then recovered an act of parliament to authorise the plan was passed on 6 june 1766 , with the stipulation that the work must be completed within 12 years , and that no work could start until 25 per cent of the capital had been raised peter muilman called a meeting in chelmsford on 2 october 1772 , to propose improvements to the river , but a subsequent meeting decided that a new cut would be a better solution the port of maldon now tried to mitigate their loss , and with advice from benjamin latrobe , produced a plan to improve the blackwater through maldon to its junction with the chelmer at beeleigh , which was submitted to parliament in 1793 the final cost was around Â£50,000 when completed , the length of the navigation was 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from springfield basin in chelmsford to the sea lock at heybridge basin the maximum headroom is 6 feet 3 inches ( 1.9 m ) they were horse-drawn , and remained so until the 1960s , when diesel outboard motors were fitted a community developed around heybridge basin , with richard tovee , a sawyer by trade , and thomas malden , a coal merchant , both buying plots of land to further their trade the first inland gasworks in britain was built in chelmsford in 1819 , using coal brought up the navigation the twelve locks on the navigation are : '' the construction of housing and restaurants around the springfield basin site took place , including coates quay and waterfront place , which meant that the basin became accessible to the public for the first time , and lockside marina was built just above springfield lock regular working parties help to keep the waterway , including the towpath , locks and other structures well maintained , and many of the recent improvements have been undertaken by the volunteers in february 2016 , the two groups worked together to upgrade of towpath near papermill lock , where a section of muddy towpath was given an all-weather surface by using 150 tons of road planings it was moved into place by electric motors driving chains , and had a hollow centre , making it partially buoyant , with the buoyancy being adjusted by the addition of ballast having checked its dimensions , northumberland water commissioned mwh global and kenneth grub to design a new gate which would fit into the existing pocket , so that no modification of the lock structure would be required each gate weighed 5.5 tonnes , and they were craned into position in february 2017 the rails and sills for the sea gate were fitted in march , and the lock was then re-opened on 31 march for the summer season , with the sea gate expected to be fitted in november image : blackwater and chelmer canal 1.jpg blackwater and chelmer canal image : papermill lock essex2.jpg papermill lock , little baddow image : papermill lock essex1.jpg papermill lock , little baddow the chelmer & blackwater navigation ltd history of the chelmer and blackwater navigation the chelmer canal trust
