the opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size ; however , some species are short-legged the second pair of legs is longer than the others and function as antennae or feelers this find indicates that the eyes in cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen they have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax , and the copulation is direct as opiliones penis , unlike other arachnids most species live for a year many species are omnivorous , eating primarily small insects and all kinds of plant material and fungi a unique feature of harvestmen is that some species practice parental care , in which the male is solely responsible for guarding the eggs resulting from multiple partners , often against egg-eating females , and cleaning the eggs regularly harvestmen clean their legs after eating by drawing each leg in turn through their jaws markings on legs can cause an interruption of the leg outline and loss of leg proportion recognition chemical and behavioral defenses of a neotropical cavernicolous harvestman : goniosoma spelaeum ( opiliones , laniatores , gonyleptidae ) many species have also been able to camouflage their bodies by covering with secretions and debris from the leaf litter found in their environments some harvestmen have elaborate and brightly colored patterns or appendages which contrast with the body coloration , potentially serving as an aposematic warning to potential predators chemoecology 14 , 5–7 secondary defenses allow for harvestmen to escape and survive from a predator after direct or indirect contact , including thanatosis , freezing , bobbing , autotomy , fleeing , stridulation , retaliation , and chemical secretions springer , berlin , heidelberg , pp while this can mean an increased likelihood of immediate survival , it also leads to reduced food and water intake processes 82 , 153–159 cabi holmberg , r.g lacking sensory ( rather than locomotive ) legs affects locomotion but not food detection in the harvestman holmbergiana weyenberghi , marta ayup , m , garcía hernández , s and yamaguti , h.y perder la cola o la vida iii congreso latinoamericano de aracnología , memorias y resúmenes ( pp multiple species within the laniatores and dyspnoi possess stridulation organs , which are used as animal communication and have also been shown to be used as a second line of defense when restrained by a predator zoology 116 , 168–174 behaviour 152 , 757–773 morphology and functional anatomy these secretions have successfully protected the harvestmen against wandering spiders ( ctenidae ) , wolf spiders ( lycosidae ) and formica exsectoides ants however , these chemical irritants are not able to prevent four species of harvestmen being preyed upon by the black scorpion bothriurus bonariensis ( bothriuridae ) comparative study of the morphology of the gland opening area among grassatores harvestmen ( arachnida , opiliones , laniatores ) of zoological systematics and evolutionary research these include pachyloidellus fulvigranulatus , which is found only on top of cerro uritorco , the highest peak in the sierras chicas chain ( provincia de cordoba ) and pachyloides borellii is in rainforest patches in northwest argentina which are in an area being dramatically destroyed by humans texella reddelli and texella reyesi are listed as endangered species in the united states indeed , one species discovered in china , mesobunus martensi , fossilized by fine-grained volcanic ash around 165 million years ago , is hardly discernible from modern-day harvestmen and has been placed in the extant family sclerosomatidae the swedish naturalist and arachnologist carl jakob sundevall ( 1801–1875 ) honored the naturalist martin lister ( 1638–1712 ) by adopting lister 's term opiliones for this order , known in lister 's days as '' harvest spiders '' or '' shepherd spiders '' , from latin opilio , '' shepherd '' ; lister characterized three species from england ( although not formally describing them , being a pre-linnean work ) martin lister 's english spiders , 1678 ( translation of the latin original , tractatus de araneis fernández r , sharma pp , tourinho al , giribet g it is not a harvestman the oldest known harvestman , from the 410-million-year-old devonian rhynie chert , displayed almost all the characteristics of modern species , placing the origin of harvestmen in the silurian , or even earlier no fossils of the cyphophthalmi or laniatores much older than 50 million years are known , despite the former presenting a basal clade , and the latter having probably diverged from the dyspnoi more than 300 mya while the two described nemastomoides species are currently grouped as dyspnoi , they look more like eupnoi trogulus longipes haupt , 1956 ( dyspnoi : trogulidae ) — geiseltal , germany philacarus hispaniolensis ( laniatores : samoidae ?
