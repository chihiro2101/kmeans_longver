increased borrowing to finance additional government purchases might also be supposed to be designed to draw out of the circulating flow an amount equal to the additional government purchases , perhaps by crowding out private borrowing for investment spending even a balanced budget fiscal stimulus—additional public purchases fully financed by equivalent increases in taxation without any additional public borrowing—may have a multiplier greater than 1 , as the increase in output and business activity reduces persistent unemployment and the anxiety driving hoarding , with resulting increases in private consumption and investment reducing the time it takes for the economy to return to full employment an additional supply of low-risk government securities may simply provide vehicles for continued hoarding as short-term government securities are regarded as closely equivalent to cash for example , it may be argued that tax cuts or spending aimed at the lowest income households , whose spending is most constrained by income , will have a higher multiplier , because such households will spend a larger fraction of any addition to income faster how potent a fiscal stimulus is in stimulating expansion of economic activity may depend on how accommodating the monetary authority—the central bank—is whether that would or should justify otherwise wasteful government spending is controversial , on the one hand , and on the other hand , whether the supposed wastefulness of government spending justifies reducing multiplier estimates that reflect only gdp effects to smaller estimates reflecting welfare effects , remains a matter of political controversy the central bank is not committed to any future course of policy by the issuing of public debt , and , in any case , there would never be a '' tradeoff '' in which it would make sense to reduce future resource employment to '' pay back '' a debt the following values are theoretical values based on simplified models that assume , for example , no changes in interest rates or the price level resulting from the fiscal action in october 2012 the international monetary fund released their global prospects and policies document in which an admission was made that their assumptions about fiscal multipliers had been inaccurate : in answering the question , we are concerned with the aggregate impact of different types of fiscal tightening on gdp ( measured using so-called ‘ fiscal multipliers ’ ) and not simply the direct contribution that government investment and consumption of goods and services makes to the expenditure measure of gdp '' 2012 obr forecast evaluation report , page 53 it has been claimed that increased fiscal activity does not always lead to increased economic activity because deficit spending can crowd out financing for other economic activity by pushing up interest rates as has been discussed , the multiplier relies on the mpc ( marginal propensity to consume ) even if it was , the nature of the consumption is not homogeneous more importantly , this consumption is much more likely to occur in local small business — local shops , pubs and other leisure activities for example these types of businesses are themselves likely to have a high mpc , and again the nature of their consumption is likely to be in the same , or next tier of businesses , and also of a benevolent nature de : multiplikator ( volkswirtschaft ) it : moltiplicatore keynesiano pl : mnożnik ( ekonomia ) ro : multiplicator ( economie ) ru : мультипликатор кейнса vi : số nhân ( kinh tế học ) zh : 乘数效应
