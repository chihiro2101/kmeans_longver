the first ni–cd battery was created by waldemar jungner of sweden in 1899 with minor improvements to the first prototypes , energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries , and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries jungner 's work was largely unknown in the united states sintered plates are usually much thinner than the pocket type , resulting in greater surface area per volume and higher currents in general , the greater amount of reactive material surface area in a battery , the lower its internal resistance for a common aa-size cell , the maximum discharge rate is approximately 1.8 & nbsp ; amperes ; for a d size battery the discharge rate can be as high as 3.5 & nbsp ; amperes model-aircraft or -boat builders often take much larger currents of up to a hundred amps or so from specially constructed ni–cd batteries , which are used to drive main motors 5–6 minutes of model operation is easily achievable from quite small batteries , so a reasonably high power-to-weight figure is achieved , comparable to internal combustion motors , though of lesser duration some would consider the near-constant voltage a drawback as it makes it difficult to detect when the battery charge is low while most pocket radios will operate satisfactorily at this voltage , some manufacturers such as varta made 8.4 & nbsp ; volt batteries with seven cells for more critical applications for example , an '' overnight '' charge , might consist of supplying a current equal to one tenth the amperehour rating ( c/10 ) for 14–16 hours ; that is , a 100 & nbsp ; mah battery takes 10 & nbsp ; ma for 14 hours , for a total of 140 & nbsp ; mah to charge at this rate during charging , the battery temperature typically stays low , around the same as the ambient temperature ( the charging reaction absorbs energy ) , but as the battery nears full charge the temperature will rise to 45–50 & nbsp ; °c it is possible to perform a trickle charge at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate ; to keep a battery fully charged gp nickel cadmium technical handbook a fully charged ni-cd cell contains : a nickel ( iii ) oxide-hydroxide positive plate electrode a cadmium negative electrode plate a separator , and an alkaline electrolyte ( potassium hydroxide ) the positive and negative electrode plates , isolated from each other by the separator , are rolled in a spiral shape inside the case this is known as the jelly-roll design and allows a ni–cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell alkaline cells have a bobbin construction where the cell casing is filled with electrolyte and contains a graphite rod which acts as the positive electrode when jungner built the first ni-cd batteries , he used nickel oxide in the positive electrode , and iron and cadmium materials in the negative until about 1960 , the chemical reaction was not completely understood traditional nicd batteries are of the sealed type , which means that charge gas is normally recombined and they release no gas unless severely overcharged or a fault develops vented cell nicd batteries have long lives ( up to 20 years or more , depending on type ) and operate at extreme temperatures ( from −40 to 70 & nbsp ; °c ) a steel battery box contains the cells connected in series to gain the desired voltage ( 1.2 & nbsp ; v per cell nominal ) another charge cycle follows at 0.1 ca rate , again until all cells have reached 1.55 v sealed ni–cd cells may be used individually , or assembled into battery packs containing two or more cells miniature button cells are sometimes used in photographic equipment , hand-held lamps ( flashlight or torch ) , computer-memory standby , toys , and novelties as of 2000 , about 1.5 billion ni–cd batteries were produced annually this many cells are mostly used in automotive and heavy-duty industrial applications where energy density is important , ni–cd batteries are now at a disadvantage compared with nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries this is in contrast , for example , to lithium ion battery , which are less stable and will be permanently damaged if discharged below a minimum voltage this results in a preference for ni–cd over non-lsd nimh batteries in applications where the current draw on the battery is lower than the battery 's own self-discharge rate ( for example , television remote controls ) this means that as the cell temperature rises , the internal resistance falls however , if the device is unable to operate through this period of decreased voltage , it will be unable to get enough energy out of the battery , and for all practical purposes , the battery appears '' dead '' earlier than normal in rare cases , much of the lost capacity can be recovered by a few deep-discharge cycles , a function often provided by automatic battery chargers this last category has been banned effective 2016 '' meps ban cadmium from power tool batteries and mercury from button cells under the same eu directive , used industrial ni–cd batteries must be collected by their producers in order to be recycled in dedicated facilities
