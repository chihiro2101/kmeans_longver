in the roman britain period , the area of modern kent that lay east of the river medway was a civitas known as cantiaca as the closest part of britain to mainland europe , it is likely that kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders , resulting in the construction of four saxon shore along the kentish coast : regulbium , rutupiae , dubris , and portus lemanis it is also likely that germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern gaul , known as foederati , would have been hired to supplement official roman troops during this period , with land in kent as payment jutish migration : 410–499 according to archaeologist martin welch , the fifth century witnessed '' a radical transformation of what became kent , politically , socially and in terms of physical landscape '' there has been much debate as to the scale of this migration ; some see it as a mass migration in which large numbers of germanic peoples left northern europe to settle in britain , pushing the native british population to western britain or brittany ; others have argued that only a small warrior elite came over , dominating ( or even enslaving ) the romano-british population , who then began using the old english language and material culture of the newcomers martin , the cruciform brooch and anglo-saxon england ( 2015 ) , pp after arriving at ypwinesfleot ( ebba 's creek , modern ebbsfleet near ramsgate ) in kent in 449 , hengist and horsa led the defeat of the picts before turning on the british and inviting more germanic tribes to colonise britain a similar account is provided in bede 's ecclesiastical history : that the people of kent and isle of wight were descended from jutish settlers , and that horsa was killed in battle against the britons , adding that his body was buried in east kent the accuracy of these accounts is questioned ; s the anglo-saxon chronicle refers to wars in sixth-century britain , but most were in the west and did not affect kent ; the one exception was a battle between the kentish and west saxons in 568 , during which æthelberht 's forces were pushed back into kent æthelberht 's reign also produced the law of æthelberht , the oldest surviving text in old english it also saw the emergence of elite burials with far greater wealth than others ; notable kentish examples have been found at sarre anglo-saxon cemetery and the kingston barrow cemetery , while the elite taplow burial in modern buckinghamshire also contained kentish characteristics , suggesting a potential kentish influence in that region decline and mercian domination : 650–825 mercia 's control of kent increased in the following decades ; by 689–690 east saxon kings under mercian overlordship were active in west kent , and there are records attesting that æthelred arbitrated on the income of the christian communities at minster-in-thanet and reculver , indicating strong mercian control over the east of the kingdom too after this , kent fell into a state of disorder this did not last , however , as offa firmly re-established his authority over kent in 785 the seventh century saw the reintroduction of masonry in anglo-saxon england , primarily for churches andrews in rochester and st mary in lyminge this suggests that from the seventh century onward , kings in kent were establishing control over the kingdom 's economic structure after king ealhmund presumably died shortly after witnessing a charter in 784 , his son egbert was driven out of kent and into exile by offa of mercia viking attacks : 825–1066 by 811 , it is recorded that vikings built fortifications on the kentish north coast , and over-wintered their armies on thanet in 851–852 and sheppey in 854–855 hoards have been found , particularly around the west kent coast , that might have been wealth hidden from the vikings they moved further inland and engaged in numerous battles with the english , but after four years they gave up
