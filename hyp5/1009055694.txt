) to demonstrate nasa 's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of 280 & nbsp ; million , including the launch vehicle and mission operations three navcam were on board the rover : two black and white 0.3-megapixel cameras were located on the front ( 768 horizontal pixels × 484 vertical pixels configured in 4×4+100 pixel blocks ) , coupled with five laser stripe projectors , which enabled stereoscopy images to be taken along with measurements for hazard detection on the rover 's path a third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back , near the apxs , and rotated by 90° the landing site was an ancient flood plain in mars 's northern hemisphere called '' ares vallis '' ( '' the valley of ares '' , the ancient greek equivalent of the ancient roman deity mars ) and is among the rockiest parts of mars mars pathfinder directly entered mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1 & nbsp ; km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell ( capsule ) that was derived from the original viking mars lander design the lander 's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20 & nbsp ; m bridle ( tether ) the lander 's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0 & nbsp ; m/s between 15 and 25 & nbsp ; m above the ground the lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to earth the landing site was located at 19.30° north latitude and 33.52° west longitude in ares vallis , only 19 kilometres southwest of the center of the 200 & nbsp ; km wide landing site ellipse as the next sols progressed it approached some rocks , which the scientists named '' barnacle bill '' , '' yogi '' , and '' scooby-doo '' , after famous cartoon characters on earth , andesite forms when magma sits in pockets of rock while some of the iron and magnesium settle out the embedded computer on board the sojourner rover was based around the 2 & nbsp ; mhz intel 80c85 cpu with 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram and 176 & nbsp ; kb of flash memory solid-state storage , running a cyclic executive the problem , which was reproduced and corrected from earth using a laboratory duplicate thanks to the logging and debugging functionality enabled in the flight software , was due to computer resets caused by priority inversion since the weakest magnet did not attract any soil , it was concluded that the airborne dust did not contain pure magnetite or just one type of maghemite communication failed after october 7 , with a final data transmission received from pathfinder at 10:23 utc on september 27 , 1997 mission managers tried to restore full communications during the following five months , but the mission was terminated on march 10 , 1998 mars reconnaissance orbiter spotted the pathfinder lander in january 2007 ( left ) the name sojourner was chosen for the mars pathfinder rover when 12-year old valerie ambroise , of bridgeport , connecticut , won a year-long , worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to select a heroine and submit an essay about her historical accomplishments first runner-up was deepti rohatgi , 18 , of rockville , maryland , who suggested scientist marie curie second runner-up was adam sheedy , 15 , of round rock , texas , who submitted the name of the late astronaut judith resnik , who perished in the 1986 space shuttle challenger explosion other popular suggestions included explorer and guide sacajewea and aviator amelia earhart monographs in aerospace history , 24 national geographic , pp & nbsp ; 2–29 '' la misión pathfinder –rebautizada carl sagan memorial station , en memoria del célebre astrónomo- , paso a paso todo marte '' , de j edición número 73 – agosto de 1997 in proceedings of the ieee aerospace conference , snowmass , co 1998 super-resolution stereo pairs of '' twin peaks '' mars pathfinder mission profile by nasa 's solar system exploration ted stryk 's mars pathfinder page '' a crawl on mars '' —ted stryk 's sojourner rover page nasa office of space science jpl—mars exploration rover mission authoritative account of mpf reset issue—discussion of the software problems on the pathfinder spacecraft a little rock on mars—children 's story about the pathfinder landing pathfinder landing site as seen from orbit by mars reconnaissance orbiter paper model ( source ) magnetic properties experiment
