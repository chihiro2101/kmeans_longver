conceptually , the vorticity could be observed by placing a tiny rough ball at the point in question , free to move with the fluid , and observing how it rotates about its center mathematically , the vorticity is defined as the curl ( or rotational ) of the velocity field of the fluid , usually denoted by \vec \omega and expressed by the vector analysis formula \nabla \times \vec , where is the limiting pressure infinitely far from the axis a vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water ( like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain ) may draw a column of air down the core as long as the effects of viscosity and diffusion are negligible , the fluid in a moving vortex is carried along with it this is a consequence of helmholtz 's second theorem for example , an airplane wing that is developing lift will create a sheet of small vortices at its trailing edge however , real fluids exhibit viscosity and this dissipates energy very slowly from the core of the vortex they are sometimes created by dolphins and whales examples are charybdis of classical mythology in the straits of messina , italy ; the naruto whirlpools of nankaido , japan ; and the maelstrom at lofoten , norway another example is the polar vortex , a persistent , large-scale cyclone centered near the earth 's poles , in the middle and upper troposphere and the stratosphere they include the permanent great red spot on jupiter , the intermittent great dark spot on neptune , the polar vortices of venus , the martian dust devils and the saturn 's hexagon of saturn sunspots are dark regions on the sun 's visible surface ( photosphere ) marked by a lower temperature than its surroundings , and intense magnetic activity vortices form from stirred fluids : they might be observed in smoke rings , whirlpools , in the wake of a boat or the winds around a tornado or dust devil when a vortex is moving , sometimes , it can affect an angular position
