if these '' deficiency needs '' are not met – except for the most fundamental ( physiological ) need – there may not be a physical indication , but the individual will feel anxious and tense maslow 's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire ( or focus motivation upon ) the secondary or higher-level needs the human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time , thus many different motivations from various levels of maslow 's hierarchy can occur at the same time physiological needs include : air homeostasis water food sex sleep health clothes shelter after physiological and safety needs are fulfilled , the third level of human needs is interpersonal and involves feelings of love and belongingness for example , some large social groups may include clubs , co-workers , religious groups , professional organizations , sports teams , gangs , and online communities deficiencies due to hospitalism , neglect , shunning , ostracism , etc '' what a man can be , he must be by these later ideas , one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself—for example , in altruism or spirituality maslow studied what he called the master race of people such as albert einstein , jane addams , eleanor roosevelt , and frederick douglass rather than mentally ill or neurosis people , writing that '' the study of crippled , stunted , immature , and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy '' maslow studied the healthiest 1 % of the college student population in their extensive review of research based on maslow 's hierarchy , wahba and bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all maslow 's hierarchy of needs fails to illustrate and expand upon the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in individualism societies and those raised in collectivism societies in collectivist societies , the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality . changes to the hierarchy by circumstance once again , only two levels of needs were identified ; therefore , people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs with regards to satisfaction of needs during the war , in the us there were three levels : physiological needs , safety needs , and psychological needs ( social , self-esteem , and self-actualization ) for the people of the middle east , the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime the authors argued that this suggested maslow 's hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age human or non-human needs after all , the latter , according to maslow , constitutes '' an inner , more biological , more instinctoid core of human nature , '' thus '' the search for one 's own intrinsic , authentic values '' checks the human freedom of choice : '' a musician must make music , '' so freedom is limited to merely the choice of instrument .
