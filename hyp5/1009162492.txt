consumer analog cassette tapes have a dynamic range of 60 to 70 & nbsp ; db typically , a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter may have a dynamic range of between 90 and 95 & nbsp ; db , whereas the signal-to-noise ratio ( roughly the equivalent of dynamic range , noting the absence of quantization noise but presence of tape hiss ) of a professional reel-to-reel ¼-inch tape recorder would be between 60 and 70 & nbsp ; db at the recorder 's rated output while undesirable , the audible effect of this can be reasonably unobjectionable it is usually a design goal of digital systems to limit high-level signals to prevent overload with vinyl records , there will be some loss in fidelity on each playing of the disc sticky-shed syndrome is a prevalent problem with older tapes tapes can also suffer creasing , stretching , and frilling of the edges of the plastic tape base , particularly from low-quality or out-of-alignment tape decks therefore , no such media deterioration takes place , and the cd will , with proper care , sound exactly the same every time it is played ( discounting aging of the player and cd itself ) ; however , this is a benefit of the optical system , not of digital recording , and the laserdisc format enjoys the same non-contact benefit with analog optical signals ( sound could , however , be stored on an m-disc dvd-r using the dvd-audio format in binary systems this is determined by and typically stated in terms of the number of bits the 16-bit digital system of red book audio cd has 2 16 65,536 possible signal amplitudes , theoretically allowing for an snr of 98 & nbsp ; db wow ( recording ) are a change in frequency of an analog device and are the result of mechanical imperfections , with wow being a slower rate form of flutter at lower levels ( −10 & nbsp ; db ) , cassettes are typically limited to 20 & nbsp ; khz due to self-erasure of the tape media the frequency response for a conventional lp player might be 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz , ±3 & nbsp ; db digital systems require that all high frequency signal content above the nyquist frequency must be removed prior to sampling , which , if not done , will result in these ultrasound frequencies '' folding over '' into frequencies which are in the audible range , producing a kind of distortion called aliasing berklee press , 2005 , ch this approach has several advantages cd quality audio is sampled at 44,100 hz ( nyquist frequency 22.05 & nbsp ; khz ) and at 16 bits sampling the waveform at higher frequencies and allowing for a greater number of bits per sample allows noise and distortion to be reduced further with any of these sampling rates , signal information is captured above what is generally considered to be the human hearing range he posits that variation is due largely to performance of the band-limiting filters in converters the redbook cd standard uses 16 bits , which keeps the quantization noise 96 & nbsp ; db below maximum amplitude , far below a discernible level with almost any source material analog systems do not necessarily have discrete digital levels in which the signal is encoded quantization in analog media . dither as a solution optimal use of dither has the effect of making quantization error independent of the signal , and allows signal information to be retained below the least significant bit of the digital system dither algorithms also commonly have an option to employ some kind of noise shaping , which pushes the frequency of much of the dither noise to areas that are less audible to human ears , lowering the level of the noise floor apparent to the listener dither is commonly applied during mastering before final bit depth reduction , and also at various stages of dsp this can be due to timing inaccuracies of the digital clock periodic jitter produces modulation noise and can be thought of as being the equivalent of analog flutter in 1998 , benjamin and gannon researched the audibility of jitter using listening tests a paper by ashihara et al their method involved abx test ashihara and kiryu 8 evaluated linearity of loudspeaker and headphones analog filters are simpler , can be more efficient and do not introduce latency analog modeling carries some benefits over their analog counterparts , such as the ability to remove noise from the algorithms and modifications to make the parameters more flexible common descriptions include whether the component has a bright or dull sound , or how well the component manages to present a spatial image critics of double-blind tests see them as not allowing the listener to feel fully relaxed when evaluating the system component , and can therefore not judge differences between different components as well as in sighted ( non-blind ) tests record companies released their first lps based on digital audio masters in the late 1970s when the original analog recording was fairly bright , remastering sometimes resulted in an unnatural treble emphasis the super audio cd ( sacd ) format was created by sony and philips , who were also the developers of the earlier standard audio cd format this claim appears to originate from a 1980 article by dr john diamond however , a double-blind subjective test between high resolution linear pcm ( dvd-audio ) and dsd did not reveal a statistically significant difference some listeners prefer such audio over that of a cd cds drain the soul from music the emotional involvement disappears '' one of the first and largest supporters of digital audio was the classical conductor herbert von karajan , who said that digital recording was '' definitely superior to any other form of recording we know '' spiral groove depth , tape magnetic field strength ) without noticeable quantization or aliasing , there are analog non-linear systems that exhibit effects similar to those encountered on digital ones , such as aliasing and '' hard '' dynamic floors ( e.g principles of digital audio 5th edn , mcgraw-hill comp
