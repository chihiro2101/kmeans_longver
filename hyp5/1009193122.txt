in a galvanic cell , the more active metal ( the anode ) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal ( the cathode ) corrodes at a slower rate galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water ( containing salts ) contacts pipes or metal structures in any given environment ( one standard medium is aerated , room-temperature seawater ) , one metal will be either more noble or more active than others , based on how strongly its ions are bound to the surface corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing , which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface the materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is thermodynamics unfavorable some metals have naturally slow chemical kinetics , even though their corrosion is thermodynamically favorable these include such metals as zinc , magnesium , and cadmium passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products , known as a passive film , on the metal 's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation while the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances , they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal , since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the ph decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process stainless steel can pose special corrosion challenges , since its passivating behavior relies on the presence of a major alloying component ( chromium , at least 11.5 % ) a stainless steel is said to be '' sensitized '' if chromium carbides are formed in the microstructure a typical microstructure of a normalized sae 304 stainless steel shows no signs of sensitization , while a heavily sensitized steel shows the presence of grain boundary precipitates in the chemical industry , hydrogen grooving is the corrosion of piping by grooves created by the interaction of a corrosive agent , corroded pipe constituents , and hydrogen gas bubbles the iron sulfate coating will protect the steel from further reaction ; however , if hydrogen bubbles contact this coating , it will be removed in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic ) , some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides , other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion for unprotected piles , sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be installed metal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities , such as synthesis gas and other high-co environments some unprotected metallic alloys are extremely vulnerable to corrosion , such as those used in neodymium magnets , which can spall or crumble into powder even in dry , temperature-stable indoor environments unless properly treated to discourage corrosion platings usually fail only in small sections , but if the plating is more noble than the substrate ( for example , chromium on steel ) , a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would khanderay , jitendra c '' green materials 5.3 ( 2017 ) : 109-122 such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating , since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed aluminium alloys often undergo a surface treatment the polarization is caused by the current flow from the anode to the cathode , driven by the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode these include high silicon cast iron , graphite , mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires anodic protection impresses anodic current on the structure to be protected ( opposite to the cathodic protection ) it is used in aggressive environments , such as solutions of sulfuric acid fundamentals of corrosion â€“ mechanisms , causes and preventative methods schweitzer , taylor and francis group , llc ( 2010 ) , p the method involves exposing a clean weighed piece of the metal or alloy to the corrosive environment for a specified time followed by cleaning to remove corrosion products and weighing the piece to determine the loss of weight quartz glass , b 2 o 3 glass or p 2 o 5 glass duran , pyrex , fiolax ) glass of this class contains essential quantities of boron oxides , aluminium oxides and alkaline-earth oxide hydrolytic class 3 ( type iii ) : glass of the 3rd hydrolytic class usually contains sodium silicate glasses and has a mean hydrolytic resistance , which is two times poorer than of type 1 glasses
