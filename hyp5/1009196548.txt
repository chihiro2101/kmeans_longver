there are generally four types of toxic entities ; chemical , biological , physical and radiation : chemical toxicants include inorganic substances such as , lead , mercury , hydrofluoric acid , and chlorine gas , and organic compounds such as methanol , most medications , and toxins in some cases , e.g when such data does not exist , estimates are made by comparison to known similar toxic things , or to similar exposures in similar organisms for example , if a dose of a toxic substance is safe for a laboratory rat , one might assume that one-tenth that dose would be safe for a human , allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow for interspecies differences between two mammals ; if the data are from fish , one might use a factor of 100 to account for the greater difference between two chordate classes ( fish and mammals ) the preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species- , organ- and dose-specific toxic effects of an investigational product toxicity testing also helps calculate the no observed adverse effect level ( noael ) dose and is helpful for clinical studies j pharmacol pharmacother serial online 2011 cited 2013 oct 12 ; 2:74-9 for substances to be regulated and handled appropriately they must be properly classified and labelled the types of toxicities where substances may cause lethality to the entire body , lethality to specific organs , major/minor damage , or cause cancer
