the second law of thermodynamics many analyses have been made of this ; all show that when the entropy of room and demon are taken together , this total entropy does increase shannon 's relation between information entropy the laws of gravity seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics ; however , specific solutions need not be since within a black hole the forward light-cone is directed towards the center and the backward light-cone is directed outward , it is not even possible to define time-reversal in the usual manner the event horizon of a black hole may be thought of as a surface moving outward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between escaping and falling back for example , according to the gaugeâ€“gravity duality conjecture , all microscopic processes in a black hole are reversible , and only the collective behavior is irreversible , as in any other macroscopic , thermal system in physical and chemical kinetics , t-symmetry of the mechanical microscopic equations implies two important laws : the principle of detailed balance and the onsager reciprocal relations time reversal transformation for fermions in quantum field theories can be represented by an 8-component spinor in which the above-mentioned t-parity can be a complex number with unit radius particle physics codified the basic laws of dynamics into the standard model however , weak measurement should not disturb the evolution so they are expected to be time-symmetric
