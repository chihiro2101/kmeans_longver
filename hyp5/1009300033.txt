his mother , henriette barthes , and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of urt and the city of bayonne when barthes was eleven , his family moved to paris , though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life he was plagued by ill health throughout this period , suffering from tuberculosis , which often had to be treated in the isolation of sanatoria they also exempted him from military service during world war ii knowing little english , barthes taught at middlebury college in 1957 and befriended the future english translator of much of his work , richard howard , that summer in new york city barthes continued to contribute with philippe sollers to the avant-garde literary magazine tel quel , which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in barthes 's writings in those same years he became primarily associated with the école des hautes études en sciences sociales ( ehess ) they had lived together for 60 years one month later , on 26 march , he died from the chest injuries he sustained in the accident in presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths , barthes argued , avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective , that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating ) in the end barthes 's mythologies became absorbed into bourgeois culture , as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon , being interested in his control over his readership structuralism and its limits as barthes 's work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with picard , his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing , which he felt was overlooked by old criticism for example , key words like 'dark ' , 'mysterious ' and 'odd ' , when integrated together , formulate a specific kind of character or 'action ' in the wake of this trip barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work , the essay '' the death of the author '' ( 1968 ) in his s/z ( 1970 ) , barthes applies this notion in an analysis of sarrasine , a balzac novella he describes this as the difference between the writerly text , in which the reader is active in a creative process , and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading in this way they were both doxa and both culturally assimilating despite this newest theory of reading , barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing , which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object he became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing , and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader . photography and henriette barthes reflecting on the relationship between the obvious symbolic meaning of a photograph ( which he called the studium ) and that which is purely personal and dependent on the individual , that which 'pierces the viewer ' ( which he called the punctum ) , barthes was troubled by the fact that such distinctions collapse when personal significance is communicated to others and can have its symbolic logic rationalized because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of barthes 's mother that can not be removed from his subjective state : the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it jonathan culler ,

his life : '' do not say mourning it 's too psychoanalytic i 'm not in mourning '' and '' in the corner of my room where she had been bedridden , where she had died and where i now sleep , in the wall where her headboard had stood against i hanged an icon—not out of faith and i always put some flowers on a table one consequence of barthes 's breadth of focus is that his legacy includes no following of thinkers dedicated to modeling themselves after him s/z : an essay the author and the scriptor in the essay he commented on the problems of the modern thinker after discovering the relativism in thought and philosophy , discrediting previous philosophers who avoided this difficulty '' the sinologist simon leys , in a review of barthes 's diary of a trip to china during the cultural revolution , disparages barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the chinese people , and says that barthes '' has contrived—amazingly—to bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity
