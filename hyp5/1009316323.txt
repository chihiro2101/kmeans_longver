myosin filaments have club-shaped heads that project toward the actin filaments the release of energy powers the swiveling of the myosin head muscle tissue also contains a stored supply of a fast acting recharge chemical , creatine phosphate , which when necessary can assist with the rapid regeneration of adp into atp when the muscle no longer needs to contract , the calcium ions are pumped from the sarcomere and back into storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum heart muscles are distinct from skeletal muscles because the muscle fibers are laterally connected to each other smooth muscles are controlled directly by the autonomic nervous system and are involuntary , meaning that they are incapable of being moved by conscious thought a group of chemical messengers cross the synapse and stimulate the formation of electrical changes , which are produced in the muscle cell when the acetylcholine binds to receptors on its surface skeletal muscles are organized into hundreds of motor units , each of which involves a motor neuron , attached by a series of thin finger-like structures called axon terminals aerobic and anaerobic muscle activity during activity that is higher in intensity , with possible duration decreasing as intensity increases , atp production can switch to anaerobic pathways , such as the use of the phosphocreatine and the phosphagen system or anaerobic glycolysis it allows for the highest levels of exercise intensity , but intramuscular stores of phosphocreatine are very limited and can only provide energy for exercises lasting up to ten seconds
