staurakios was not given an official government position upon his father 's accession to the throne , but , in the summer of 803 , bardanes tourkos revolted against nikephoros in the anatolic theme ; although his revolt was put down by early september , it convinced nikephoros to consolidate his hold on the throne by declaring staurakios co-emperor and heir , which he did on 25 december 803 the victorious byzantine forces began to march back to the byzantine empire , but a desperate krum managed to trap the byzantine army in a small valley with palisades , before launching a massive assault two days later , on 26 july 811 the severity of staurakios wounds led to speculation as to whether he would live , although eventually they judged he would make the best candidate , as the legitimate successor , and declared him emperor staurakios was brought by litter to constantinople by this time , it had been discovered that he had blood in his urine , and was paralyzed from the waist down staurakios wavered between two possible options for succession staurakios summoned his relative , symon the monk , and was tonsured and dressed in monastic garb staurakios also sent a letter of protest to patriarch nikephoros for his role in the coup d ’ état ; nikephoros answered in person , writing alongside michael and prokopia , and assured staurakios that he had not betrayed him , but rather protected him according to the syriac sources—the chronicle of 813 and michael the syrian—and the chronicle of the petros of alexandria , there were rumors that staurakios had been poisoned by his sister prokopia , rather than dying of gangrene although many historians believe that both nikephoros i and staurakios have been falsely portrayed as malevolent , few other sources exist for their reign staurakios reigned only two months and eight days , and was therefore unable to leave a mark on the empire as his father had done
