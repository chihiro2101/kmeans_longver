the largest loss of life on board a single-aircraft is the 520 fatalities in the 1985 japan airlines flight 123 incident , the largest loss of life in multiple aircraft in a single incident is the 583 fatalities in the two airplanes that collided in the 1977 tenerife airport disaster , while the largest loss of life overall in a collective incident is the 2,996 fatalities in the coordinated terrorist destruction of airplanes and occupied buildings in the 2001 september 11 attacks 583 : the tenerife airport disaster , which occurred on march 27 , 1977 , remains the accident with the highest number of airliner passenger fatalities '' cockpit resource management '' has also been incorporated into flight crew training the aircraft suffered an explosive decompression from an incorrectly repaired aft pressure bulkhead , which failed in mid flight , destroying most of its vertical stabilizer and severing all of the hydraulic lines , making the 747 virtually uncontrollable pilots were able to keep the plane flying for 32 minutes after the mechanical failure before crashing into a mountain rescue operations were delayed until the following morning 349 : on november 12 , 1996 , the charkhi dadri mid-air collision took place between saudia flight 763 and kazakhstan airlines flight 1907 over charkhi dadri , india it remains the world 's deadliest mid-air collision all 307 passengers and 22 crew members died 301 : on august 19 , 1980 , saudi arabian airlines flight 163 , a lockheed l-1011 , became the world 's deadliest aviation accident that did not involve a crash the crew performed an emergency landing at riyadh after a fire broke out in an aft baggage compartment 298 : on july 17 , 2014 , malaysia airlines flight 17 , a boeing 777-200er , flying from amsterdam to kuala lumpur with 298 people on board , was shot down in an area of eastern ukraine near the ukraine/russian border during the war in donbass there were 283 passengers , including 3 infants , and 15 crew members on board mh17 , all of whom perished this post was removed later the same day , and the separatists then denied shooting down any aircraft navy guided missile cruiser uss vincennes over the strait of hormuz the crash resulted in the deaths of all 271 passengers and crew on board , as well as two people on the ground all 243 passengers and 16 crew , and 11 people on the ground ( all residents of sherwood crescent , lockerbie ) , died , making it the worst terrorist attack involving an aircraft in the uk and the deadliest terrorist attack on british soil kennedy international airport bound for las américas international airport , santo domingo 264 : on april 26 , 1994 , china airlines flight 140 was completing a routine flight and approach at nagoya airport , japan , when the airbus a300 's first officer inadvertently pressed the takeoff/go-around switch , which raises the throttle position to the same as take offs and go-arounds the canadian aviation safety board investigating the cause of the crash issued two different reports : the majority report cited ice on the wings as cause of the crash ; the minority report suggests an explosion was the likely cause numerous theories have been offered to explain the disappearance of the flight , but none has been confirmed 230 : on july 17 , 1996 , a boeing 747-131 , twa flight 800 , carrying 212 passengers and 18 crew , exploded and crashed into the atlantic ocean near east moriches , new york , shortly after departing from john f 229 : on september 2 , 1998 , a mcdonnell douglas md-11 , swissair flight 111 , carrying 215 passengers and 14 crew from new york city to geneva , switzerland crashed into the atlantic ocean near halifax , nova scotia , canada , killing all aboard it was determined that the crash , which killed all 206 passengers and 19 crewmembers aboard the plane , was caused by improper repairs to the aircraft 22 years earlier when the aircraft encountered a tailstrike both of these manufacturers place a huge emphasis on the use of aviation safety equipment , now a billion-dollar industry in its own right ; safety is a key selling point for these companies , as they recognize that a poor safety record in the aviation industry is a threat to corporate survival some major safety devices now required in commercial aircraft are : evacuation slides , to aid rapid passenger exit from an aircraft in an emergency situation advanced avionics , incorporating computerized auto-recovery and alert systems turbine engines with improved durability and failure containment mechanisms landing gear that can be lowered even after loss of power and hydraulics measured on a passenger-distance calculation , air travel is the safest form of transportation available : figures mentioned are the ones shared by the air industry when quoting air safety statistics when compared to all other modes of transport , on a 'fatality per mile basis ' , air transport is the safest & nbsp ; — six times safer than traveling by car ; twice as safe as rail between 1983 and 2000 , the survival rate for people in u.s . global aeronautical distress and safety system note that acro only considers crashes in which the aircraft has suffered such damage that it is removed from service , which will further reduce the statistics for incidents and fatalities compared to some other data the total number of incidents is 11,164 according to acro , recent years have been considerably safer for aviation , with fewer than 170 incidents every year between 2009 and 2017 , compared to as many as 226 as recently as 1998 blagnac cedex , france : airbus , 2015 13p shrewsbury : airlife , 1997 401p s a cullen md frcpath fraes the asn safety database contains descriptions of over 15800 airliner , military and corporate jet aircraft accidents/incidents since 1921 national transportation safety board aviation accident synopses – by month aviation statistics statistical and geospatial analysis of general aviation accidents
