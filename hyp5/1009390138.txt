in addition , applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration the confirmatory hiv test employs a western blot to detect anti-hiv antibody in a human serum sample another application is in the diagnosis of tularemia in veterinary medicine , a western blot is sometimes used to confirm fiv+ status in cats each is prohibited under wada 's list of prohibited substances and methods the western blot technique was used during the 2014 fifa world cup in the anti-doping campaign for that event in total , over 1000 samples were collected and analyzed by reichel , et al in the wada accredited laboratory of lausanne , switzerland the western blot method is composed of a gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-d structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide , followed by an electrophoretic transfer onto a membrane ( mostly pvdf or nitrocellulose ) and an immunostaining procedure to visualize a certain protein on the blot membrane sds-page is generally used for the denaturing electrophoretic separation of proteins following electrophoretic separation , the proteins are transferred to a membrane ( typically nitrocellulose or pvdf ) , where they are blocked with milk ( or other blocking agents ) to prevent non-specific antibody binding , and then stained with antibody specific to the target protein sds-page ( sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ) maintains polypeptides in a denatured state once they have been treated with strong reducing agents to remove secondary and tertiary structure ( e.g the lower the acrylamide concentration , the better the resolution of higher molecular weight proteins it is also possible to use a two-dimensional gel which spreads the proteins from a single sample out in two dimensions normalization with the so-called '' loading control '' was based on immunostaining of housekeeping proteins in the classical procedure , but is heading toward total protein staining recently , due to multiple benefits following incubation , the membrane is washed several times in wash buffer to remove unbound primary antibody , and thereby minimize background typically , the wash buffer solution is composed of buffered saline solution with a small percentage of detergent , and sometimes with powdered milk or bsa therefore , an anti-mouse secondary antibody will bind to almost any mouse-sourced primary antibody , and can be referred to as an 'anti-species ' antibody ( e.g anti-mouse , anti-goat etc given the advent of high-throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection , however , there has been interest in developing one-step probing systems that would allow the process to occur faster and with fewer consumables ( see western blot normalization ) development of the blot is then stopped by washing away the soluble dye the use of film for western blot detection is slowly disappearing because of non linearity of the image ( non accurate quantification ) the image is analysed by densitometry , which evaluates the relative amount of protein staining and quantifies the results in terms of optical density the fluorescently labeled probe is excited by light and the emission of the excitation is then detected by a photosensor such as a ccd camera equipped with appropriate emission filters which captures a digital image of the western blot and allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis and a quantitative western blot analysis while there are well-established protocols available for stripping nitrocellulose membranes , the sturdier pvdf allows for easier stripping , and for more reuse before background noise limits experiments for example , in the first dimension , polypeptides are separated according to isoelectric point , while in the second dimension , polypeptides are separated according to their molecular weight lysine , arginine ) and negatively ( e.g a protein that has been phosphorylated ( by addition of a negatively charged group )
