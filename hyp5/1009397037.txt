rayon and its variants swiss chemist matthias eduard schweizer ( 1818–1860 ) discovered that cellulose dissolves in schweizer 's reagent over 100 years old and still going strong from glanzstoff ( artificial silk ) factory to industry park industriepark-oberbruch.de production of cuprammonium rayon for textiles started in 1899 in the vereinigte glanzstoff fabriken ag in oberbruch near aachen bemberg ag was one of the vereinigte glanzstoff-fabriken which merged into the dutch based algemene kunstzijde unie ( aku ) -- akzonobel today english chemist charles frederick cross and his collaborators , edward john bevan and clayton beadle , patented their artificial silk in 1894 courtaulds formed an american division , american viscose ( later known as avtex fibers ) , to produce their formulation in the united states in 1910 the name '' rayon '' was adopted in 1924 , with '' viscose '' being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane the viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose , whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as a starting material the use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper , so it was traditionally used on a larger scale than the other methods nitrocellulose is a derivative of cellulose that is soluble in organic solvents rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers , although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon it can imitate the feel and texture of silk , wool , cotton and linen however , hwm rayon ( high-wet-modulus rayon ) is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention hwm rayon can be machine-washed rayon fibers are naturally very bright , but the addition of delustering pigments cuts down on this natural brightness the alkali cellulose is then treated with carbon disulfide to form sodium cellulose xanthate the thread made from the regenerated cellulose is washed to remove residual acid the sulfur is then removed by the addition of sodium sulfide solution and impurities are oxidized by bleaching with sodium hypochlorite solution or hydrogen peroxide solution the aged '' white crumb '' is mixed in vats with carbon disulfide to form the xanthate ( see chemical equation above ) to exploit the process tencel , generic name lyocell , is made by a slightly different solvent recovery process , and is considered a different fiber by the us ftc which was part of the vereinigte glanstoff fabriken that were absorbed into the dutch aku , akzonobel today indonesia is one of the largest producers of rayon in the world , and asia pacific rayon ( apr ) of the country has an annual production capacity of 0.24 million tons much attention has been paid to the toxicity of carbon disulfide use in the viscose process courtaulds fibers , inc historically , however , several incidents have resulted in many poisonings with production facilities often located in developing countries , concerns for worker safety continue nitrocellulose , another form of modified cellulose cellophane ( sheet-extruded viscose rayon ) hilaire de chardonnet ray p art silk cellophane sausage casings velvet gupta , vb ; kothari , vk and sengupta , ak eds chapman & hall , london for a description of the production method at a factory in germany in world war ii , see agnès humbert ( tr the romance of rayon whittaker & robinson , manchester and hard , arnold ( 1944 ) the story of rayon , united trade press ltd , london what is viscose ? from barnhardt natural fibers viscose fibre
