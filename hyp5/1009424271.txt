classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs ) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus ( us ) pavlov called the dogs ' anticipatory salivation '' psychic secretion '' the sound of a metronome ) and then gave the dog food ; after a few repetitions , the dogs started to salivate in response to the stimulus learning is fastest in forward conditioning for example : if a person hears a bell and has air puffed into their eye at the same time , and repeated pairings like this led to the person blinking when they hear the bell despite the puff of air being absent , this demonstrates that simultaneous conditioning has occurred second-order or higher-order conditioning follow a two-step procedure for example : a bell might be paired with food until the bell elicits salivation the example below shows the temporal conditioning , as us such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds when this is done , the cr frequency eventually returns to pre-training levels the speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors , such as the nature and strength of both the cs and the us , previous experience and the animal 's motivational state the process slows down as it nears completion at this point the cr is said to be '' extinguished reinstatement : if the us used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred , but without the cs being present , the cs often elicits a response when it is tested later stimulus generalization is said to occur if , after a particular cs has come to elicit a cr , a similar test stimulus is found to elicit the same cr this can be brought about by , for example , pairing cs1 with an effective us and presenting cs2 with no us cs+/us trials are continued , but these are interspersed with trials on which the cs+ is paired with a second cs , ( the cs- ) but not with the us ( i.e typically , organisms show crs on cs+/us trials , but stop responding on cs+/cs− trials summation test for conditioned inhibition : the cs- from phase 2 is presented together with a new cs+ that was conditioned as in phase 1 if conditioned inhibition has occurred , the rate of acquisition to the previous cs− should be less than the rate of acquisition that would be found without the phase 2 treatment this form of classical conditioning involves two phases experiments on theoretical issues in conditioning have mostly been done on vertebrates , especially rats and pigeons however , conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates , and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug , aplysia most relevant experiments have used the classical conditioning procedure , although operant conditioning experiments have also been used , and the strength of classical conditioning is often measured through its operant effects , as in conditioned suppression ( see phenomena section above ) and autoshaping according to pavlov , conditioning does not involve the acquisition of any new behavior , but rather the tendency to respond in old ways to new stimuli pavlov himself observed that a dog 's saliva produced as a cr differed in composition from that produced as a ur ( however , it has been proposed that only when the ur does not involve the central nervous system are the cr and the ur opposites however , after conditioning , the subject is no longer surprised , because the cs predicts the coming of the us \delta v \alpha\beta ( \lambda - \sigma v ) this is the rescorla-wagner equation σv is the sum of the strengths of all stimuli present in the situation λ is the maximum associative strength that a given us will support ; its value is usually set to 1 on trials when the us is present , and 0 when the us is absent that is , the us is fully predicted , the associative strength of the cs stops growing , and conditioning is complete r–w model : extinction the associative process described by the r–w model also accounts for extinction ( see '' procedures '' above ) the extinction procedure starts with a positive associative strength of the cs , which means that the cs predicts that the us will occur the r–w explanation of the blocking phenomenon illustrates one consequence of the assumption just stated since there is no difference between what is predicted and what happens , no new learning happens on the additional trials with cs1+cs2 , hence cs2 later yields no response following are brief summaries of some related theoretical issues the r–w model can not explain this because preexposure leaves the strength of the cs unchanged at zero recovery of responding after extinction : it appears that something remains after extinction has reduced associative strength to zero because several procedures cause responding to reappear without further conditioning . role of attention in learning pearce and hall in 2010 integrated their attentional ideas and even suggested the possibility of incorporating the rescorla-wagner equation into an integrated model however , as students know all too well , performance in a test situation is not always a good measure of what has been learned at the time of the test , these associations are compared , and a response to the cs occurs only if the cs-us association is stronger than the context-us association blocking and other more subtle phenomena can also be explained by comparator theories , though , again , they can not explain everything more flexibility is provided by assuming that a stimulus is internally represented by a collection of elements , each of which may change from one associative state to another ) secondary activity ( a2 ) - the stimulus is “ peripherally attended to from the a1 state they gradually decay to a2 , and finally back to i the model can explain the findings that are accounted for by the rescorla-wagner model and a number of additional findings as well the rise and decay of element activation enables the model to explain time-dependent effects such as the fact that conditioning is strongest when the cs comes just before the us , and that when the cs comes after the us ( “ backward conditioning ” ) the result is often an inhibitory cs neural basis of learning and memory it appears that other regions of the brain , including the hippocampus , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex , contribute to the conditioning process , especially when the demands of the task get more complex presynaptic activation of protein kinase a and postsynaptic activation of nmda receptors and its signal transduction pathway are necessary for conditioning related plasticity for example , a medication might be used to associate the taste of alcohol with stomach upset systematic desensitization is a treatment for phobias in which the patient is trained to relax while being exposed to progressively more anxiety-provoking stimuli ( e.g a stimulus that is present when a drug is administered or consumed may eventually evoke a conditioned physiological response that mimics the effect of the drug signals that consistently precede food intake can become conditioned stimuli for a set of bodily responses that prepares the body for food and digestion the lateral hypothalamus ( lh ) is involved in the initiation of eating the influence of classical conditioning can be seen in emotional responses such as phobia , disgust , nausea , anger , and sexual arousal as an adaptive mechanism , emotional conditioning helps shield an individual from harm or prepare it for important biological events such as sexual activity for example , sexual arousal has been conditioned in human subjects by pairing a stimulus like a picture of a jar of pennies with views of an erotic film clip pavlovian-instrumental transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when a conditioned stimulus ( cs , also known as a '' cue '' ) that has been associated with rewarding or aversive stimuli via classical conditioning alters motivational salience and operant behavior unintentionally , he also forms an aversion to classical music this is a tactic used in order to elicit a response advertising on game shows is one of many examples
