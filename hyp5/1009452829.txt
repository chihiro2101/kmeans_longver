while in a pc context the usual result is a system crash , more subtle errors can go undetected , which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as data corruption ( incorrectly calculated results , or worse writing to storage incorrectly ) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks ( general usage such as internet browsing and word processing appear fine , but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system ) at this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed , but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output , as well as shorten the lifespan further reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow quiet pc , and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge however again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success , and the builder 's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components , such as , processors ( a.k.a cpu ) , video cards , motherboard chipsets , and ram most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock ( processor bus speed ) by an internal multiplier within the processor ( the cpu multiplier ) to attain their final speed the same processor installed on a different motherboard offering adjustments will allow the user to change them the end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available cpu multipliers , bus dividers , voltages ; the user 's ability to manage thermal loads , cooling techniques ; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances , interaction with other components and the rest of the system conversely , the overclocker may decide to decrease the chip voltage while overclocking ( a process known as undervolting ) , to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use ; overclocked circuits can require more cooling , such as by powerful fans , larger heat sinks , heat pipes and water cooling efficient heatsinks are often made entirely of copper , which has high thermal conductivity , but is expensive heat pipes can be used to improve conductivity this method of cooling is highly effective , but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away , often by a convection-based heatsink or a water cooling system liquid nitrogen , liquid helium , and dry ice are used as coolants in extreme cases , such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system cooling baths – chemwiki stability and functional correctness popular stress tests include prime95 , lavalys , superpi , occt , aida64 , linpack ( via the linx and intelburntest guis ) , sisoft sandra , boinc , intel thermal analysis tool and memtest86 many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones , while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical . measuring effects of overclocking because of this , benchmark scores may be qualified with stability and correctness notes ( e.g manufacturer and vendor overclocking the seller makes more money by overclocking lower-priced components which are found to operate correctly and selling equipment at prices appropriate for higher-rated components users usually unlock cpus to allow overclocking , but sometimes to allow for underclocking in order to maintain the front side bus speed ( on older cpus ) compatibility with certain motherboards amd athlon and athlon xp cpus are generally unlocked by connecting bridges ( jumper-like points ) on the top of the cpu with conductive paint or graphite intel intended to block base clock ( bclk ) overclocking of locked processors when designing the skylake architecture to prevent consumers from purchasing cheaper components and overclocking to previously-unseen heights ( since the cpu 's bclk was no longer tied to the pci buses ) , however for lga1151 , the 6th generation '' skylake '' processors were able to be overclocked past 102.7 mhz ( which was the intended limit by intel , and was later mandated through later bios updates ) for instance : many motherboards with athlon 64 processors limit the clock rate of four units of ram to 333 mhz the hot air blown out of the case heats the room it 's in acoustic foam can reduce noise article id : 310064 – last review : may 7 , 2007 – revision : 6.2 how to troubleshoot problems during installation when you upgrade from windows 98 or windows millennium edition to windows xp microsoft says this of errors in upgrading to windows xp : '' your computer may be over-clocked warranties may be voided by overclocking john wiley & sons , 2020 - 240 pages graphics cards can also be overclocked excessive voltage increases may damage or destroy components on the graphics card or the entire graphics card itself ( practically speaking ) nibitor ( geforce 6/7 series are well regarded in this aspect ) , without using firmware for a better model video card for example , nvidia 's geforce ( agp flavor ) has a temperature monitor used internally by the card , invisible to the user if standard firmware is used unlocking refers to enabling extra pipelines or pixel shaders overclocked processors first became commercially available in 1983 , when amd sold an overclocked version of the intel 8088 cpu
