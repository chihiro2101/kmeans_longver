the details of rameau 's life are generally obscure , especially concerning his first forty years , before he moved to paris for good he was a secretive man , and even his wife knew nothing of his early life , beaussant p early years , 1683–1732 he was born on 25 september 1683 in dijon , and baptised the same day on his return , he worked as a violinist in travelling companies and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals before moving to paris for the first time four collaborations followed , beginning with l'endriague in 1723 ; none of the music has survived 215 on 25 february 1726 rameau married the 19-year-old marie-louise mangot , who came from a musical family from lyon and was a good singer and instrumentalist the couple would have four children , two boys and two girls , and the marriage is said to have been a happy one rameau 's hippolyte et aricie premiered at the académie royale de musique on 1 october 1733 all these operas of the 1730s are among rameau 's most highly regarded works rameau produced his most important comic opera , platée , as well as two collaborations with voltaire : the opéra-ballet le temple de la gloire and the comédie-ballet la princesse de navarre sometimes he would meet the young writer chabanon , who noted some of rameau 's disillusioned confidential remarks : '' day by day , i 'm acquiring more good taste , but i no longer have any genius '' and '' the imagination is worn out in my old head ; it 's not wise at this age wanting to practise arts that are nothing but imagination 846 rameau died on 12 september 1764 after suffering from a fever , thirteen days before his 81st birthday at his bedside , he objected to a song sung '' he was buried in the church of st he had a '' loud voice financial security came late to him , following the success of his stage works and the grant of a royal pension ( a few months before his death , he was also ennobled and made a knight of the ordre de saint-michel ) general character of rameau 's music rameau 's musical works rameau 's musical works may be divided into four distinct groups , apart from the pieces written for the paris fairs , which have n't survived which differ greatly in importance : a few cantatas ; a few motets for large chorus ; some pieces for solo harpsichord or harpsichord accompanied by other instruments ; and , finally , his works for the stage , to which he dedicated the last thirty years of his career almost exclusively only four motets have been attributed to rameau with any certainty : deus noster refugium , in convertendo , quam dilecta , and laboravi the first set of dances ( allemande , courante , sarabande , les trois mains , fanfairenette , la triomphante , gavotte et 6 doubles ) is centred on a major and a minor , while the remaining pieces ( les tricoteuses , l'indifferente , première menuet , deuxième menuet , la poule , les triolets , les sauvages , l'enharmonique , l'egiptienne sic ) are centred around g major and g minor 1750 ) has also been attributed to him 14–52 new grove pp ) and sections that were spoken or almost spoken ( recitativo secco ) a few pieces are particularly striking , such as the overture to zaïs , depicting the chaos before the creation of the universe , that of pigmalion , suggesting the sculptor 's chipping away at the statue with his mallet , or many more conventional depictions of storms and earthquakes , as well perhaps as the imposing final chaconnes of les indes galantes or dardanus '' quoted by girdlestone , p during the first part of his operatic career ( 1733–1739 ) , rameau wrote his great masterpieces destined for the académie royale de musique : three tragédies en musique and two opéra-ballets that still form the core of his repertoire after the interval of 1740 to 1744 , he became the official court musician , and for the most part , composed pieces intended to entertain , with plenty of dance music emphasising sensuality and an idealised pastoral atmosphere according to one of rameau 's admirers , cuthbert girdlestone , this opera has a distinctive place in his works : '' the profane passions of hatred and jealousy are rendered more intensely than in his other works and with a strong sense of reality rameau and his librettists many rameau specialists have regretted that the collaboration with houdar de la motte never took place , and that the samson project with voltaire came to nothing because the librettists rameau did work with were second-rate tommaso traetta produced two operas setting translations of rameau libretti that show the french composer 's influence , ippolito ed aricia ( 1759 ) and i tintaridi ( based on castor et pollux , 1760 ) 201–02 many of the operatic reforms advocated in the preface to gluck 's alceste were already present in rameau 's works as rameau biographer j a detailed comparison allows us to affirm that gluck could replace rameau on the french stage only by assimilating the latter 's beautiful works and making them his own '' camille saint-saëns ( by editing and publishing the pièces in 1895 ) and paul dukas were two other important french musicians who gave practical championship to rameau 's music in their day , but interest in rameau petered out again , and it was not until the late 20th century that a serious effort was made to revive his works heavily influenced by new cartesian modes of thought and analysis , rameau 's methodology incorporated mathematics , commentary , analysis and a didacticism that was specifically intended to illuminate , scientifically , the
