this directionality is because rna polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3 ' end of the growing mrna chain in the '' closed complex '' the promoter dna is still fully double-stranded '' rna polymerase , assisted by one or more general transcription factors , then selects a transcription start site in the transcription bubble , binds to an initiating ntp and an extending ntp ( or a short rna primer and an extending ntp ) complementary to the transcription start site sequence , and catalyzes bond formation to yield an initial rna product in bacteria , rna polymerase holoenzyme consists of five subunits : 2 α subunits , 1 β subunit , 1 β ' subunit , and 1 ω subunit in archaea , there are three general transcription factors : tbp , tfb , and tfe as transcription proceeds , rna polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the dna template to create an rna copy ( which elongates during the traversal ) although rna polymerase traverses the template strand from 3 ' → 5 ' , the coding ( non-template ) strand and newly formed rna can also be used as reference points , so transcription can be described as occurring 5 ' → 3 ' transcription termination in eukaryotes is less well understood than in bacteria , but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3 ' end , in a process called polyadenylation an example of such an antibacterial is rifampicin , which inhibits bacterial transcription of dna into mrna by inhibiting dna-dependent rna polymerase by binding its beta-subunit , while 8-hydroxyquinoline is an antifungal transcription inhibitor retrieved feb 2012 the effects of histone methylation may also work to inhibit the action of transcription potent , bioactive natural products like triptolide that inhibit mammalian transcription via inhibition of the xpb subunit of the general transcription factor tfiih has been recently reported as a glucose conjugate for targeting hypoxic cancer cells with increased glucose transporter expression colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations for example , in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally inhibited by cpg island methylation ( see regulation of transcription in cancer ) transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanisms , such as altered expression of micrornas there are ~10,000 factories in the nucleoplasm of a hela cell , among which are ~8,000 polymerase ii factories and ~2,000 polymerase iii factories severo ochoa won a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1959 for developing a process for synthesizing rna in vitro with polynucleotide phosphorylase , which was useful for cracking the genetic code rna synthesis by rna polymerase was established in vitro by several laboratories by 1965 ; however , the rna synthesized by these enzymes had properties that suggested the existence of an additional factor needed to terminate transcription correctly transcription can be measured and detected in a variety of ways : g-less cassette transcription assay : measures promoter strength run-off transcription assay : identifies transcription start sites ( tss ) nuclear run-on assay : measures the relative abundance of newly formed transcripts kas-seq : measures single-stranded dna generated by rna polymerases ; can work with 1,000 cells in the case of hiv , reverse transcriptase is responsible for synthesizing a complementary dna strand ( cdna ) to the viral rna genome however , in other retroviruses , the host cell remains intact as the virus buds out of the cell with this '' junk '' dna or '' cap '' at the ends of chromosomes , the shortening eliminates some of the non-essential , repeated sequence rather than the protein-encoding dna sequence , that is farther away from the chromosome end telomerase is often activated in cancer cells to enable cancer cells to duplicate their genomes indefinitely without losing important protein-coding dna sequence
