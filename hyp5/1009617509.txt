the term '' operon '' was first proposed in a short paper in the proceedings of the french academy of science in 1960 elegans and the fruit fly , drosophila operons are related to regulons , stimulons and modulons ; whereas operons contain a set of genes regulated by the same operator , regulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single regulatory protein , and stimulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single cell stimulus . as a unit of transcription however , the definition of an operon does not require the mrna to be polycistronic , though in practice , it usually is all the structural genes of an operon are turned on or off together , due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them , but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed in rna synthesis , promoters indicate which genes should be used for messenger rna creation – and , by extension , control which proteins the cell produces in negative inducible operons , a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator , which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon the trp operon , involved in the synthesis of tryptophan ( which itself acts as the corepressor ) , is a negatively controlled repressible operon in positive inducible operons , activator proteins are normally unable to bind to the pertinent dna it can be activated by allolactose discovered in 1953 by jacques monod and colleagues , the trp operon in e in the lac operon , lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription , while in the trp operon , tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription one prediction method uses the intergenic distance between reading frames as a primary predictor of the number of operons in the genome the separation merely changes the frame and guarantees that the read through is efficient longer stretches exist where operons start and stop , often up to 40–50 bases pascale cossart 's laboratory was the first to experimentally identify all operons of a microorganism , listeria monocytogenes
