in the late 1970s , vmebus was faster than the parts plugged into it in order to do this the primary technology of futurebus was built using asynchronous links , allowing the devices plugged into it to talk at whatever speed they wished this required some form of '' distributed arbitration '' to allow the various cards to gain access to the bus at any point , as opposed to vme , which put a single master in slot 0 with overall control that was just in time for the us navy who had been looking for a new high-speed system for the next generation computer resources ( ngcr ) project for passing sonar data around in their newly designed seawolf-class submarine , and they said they would standardize on futurebus if only a few more changes would be made the decade-long performance gap they gave the system had evaporated in the decade-long standards process , and conventional local bus systems like pci were close in performance terms futurebus effort did act as a catalyst for simpler serial technologies futurebus+ was used as the i/o bus in the dec 4000 axp and dec 10000 axp systems to understand futurebus+ you need to read many ieee standards : 896.1-1991 ieee standard for futurebus+ — logical protocol specification 896.2-1991 ieee standard backplane bus specification for multiprocessor architectures : futurebus+ 896.3-1993 ieee recommended practice for futurebus+ 896.4-1993 ieee standard for conformance test requirements for futurebus+ 896.5-1993 ieee standard for futurebus+ , profile m ( military ) 896.6 futurebus+ telecommunications systems , profile t ( telecommunications ) 896.7 interconnect between futurebus+ systems 896.8 small computer expandibility module for futurebus+ systems , profile d ( desktop ) 896.9-1994 fault tolerant extensions to the futurebus+ architecture 896.10-1997 standard for futurebus+ spaceborne systems - profile s 896.11 standard for ieee 1355 links on futurebus+ backplane connector 896.12 standard for fault tolerance classification of computer-based systems 1194.1-1991 ieee standard for electrical characteristics of backplane transceiver logic ( btl ) interface circuits 1301 standard for metric equipment practice for microcomputers - coordination document 1301.1-1991 ieee standard for a metric equipment practice for microcomputers—convection-cooled with 2 & nbsp ; mm connectors 1156.1 standard microprocessor environmental specifications for computer modules eia is-64 ( 1991 ) 2 & nbsp ; mm two-part connectors for use with printed boards and backplanes 896.2 contains three profiles for target markets , a for general purpose systems , b for an i/o bus , and f for a futurebus+ will all the options that will make it go fast profile b was sponsored by digital equipment corporation and implemented in vax and alpha systems as an i/o bus profile f was sponsored by john theus while he worked at tektronix and was intended for high end workstations in the end this was replaced by a central arbiter
