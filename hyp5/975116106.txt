as a result of the astrographic congress of more than 50 astronomers held in paris in april 1887 , 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project , and two goals were established : for the first , the astrographic catalogue , the entire sky was to be photographed to 11 & nbsp ; mag to provide a reference catalogue of star positions that would fill the magnitude gap between those previously observed by transit and meridian circle instrument observations down to 8 & nbsp ; mag & ndash ; this would provide the positions of a reasonably dense network of star positions which could in turn be used as a reference system for the fainter survey component ( the carte du ciel ) for the second goal , a second set of plates , with longer exposures but minimal overlap , was to photograph all stars to 14 & nbsp ; mag a fascinating contemporary account of this vast international astronomical collaboration , published in 1912 , is given by herbert hall turner , then savilian professor of astronomy at oxford university the measurable areas of the plates were 2.1°×2.1° ( 13 & nbsp ; cm×13 & nbsp ; cm ) , so the overlap pattern consisted of plates that were centred on every degree band in declination , but offset in right ascension by two degrees in total , some 4.6 & nbsp ; million stars ( 8.6 & nbsp ; million images ) were observed publication of the measurements proceeded from 1902 to 1964 , and resulted in 254 printed volumes of raw data as originally envisaged , the project was meant to have taken only 10 to 15 years a more serious problem was that while many european astronomers were preoccupied with this project , which required steady , methodical labor rather than creativity , in other parts of the world notably the united states astrophysics was becoming far more important than astrometry the carte du ciel the proper motions of all the tycho catalogue stars could then be derived especially thanks to the astrographic catalogue , but additionally using star positions from more than 140 other ground-based catalogues henry chamberlain russell for further details of the australian contribution iau commission 8 working group , includes a photograph of nuns measuring the vatican plate collection ( 1910–1921 ) histoire de l'observatoire de toulouse ( with a section on the carte du ciel ) a compilation of historical material by the palermo observatory
