the family is known from fossils of the extinct genus paleoleishmania preserved in burmese amber dating to the albian ( 100 mya ) and dominican amber from the burdigalian ( 20–15 mya ) of hispaniola fifteen genera are recognised in the trypanosomatidae and there are three subfamilies – blechomonadinae , leishmaniinae and strigomonadinae 2000 genus zelonia shaw , camargo et teixeira 2016 subfamily phytomonadinae kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus herpetomonas kent 1880 non donovan 1909 genus lafontella kostygov & yurchenko 2015 genus phytomonas donovan 1909 subfamily strigomonadinae votypka et al different species go through a range of different morphologies at different stages of the life cycle , with most having at least two different morphologies typically the promastigote and epimastigote forms are found in insect hosts , trypomastigote forms in the mammalian bloodstream and amastigotes in intracellular environments for example , the amastigote ( prefix '' a- '' , meaning no flagellum ) form is also known as the leishmanial form as all leishmania have an amastigote life cycle stage in trypomastigotes the kinetoplast is near the posterior end of the body , and the flagellum lies attached to the cell body for most of its length by an undulating membrane image : leishmaniamexicana amastigote sem.jpg amastigote : false colour sem micrograph of amastigote form leishmania mexicana the cell body is shown in orange and the flagellum is in red
