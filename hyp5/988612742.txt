this signal closely matches a traditional black and white television signal and the y/c method of encoding was key to offering backward compatibility once the y signal is produced , it is subtracted from the blue signal to produce pb and from the red signal to produce pr a signal with three components is no easier to broadcast than the original three-signal rgb , so additional processing is required each of these steps is subject to deliberate or unavoidable loss of quality this signal contains two color-difference components compared with component video , which carries the identical luminance signal but separates the color-difference signals into cb/pb and cr/pr , the color resolution of s-video is limited by the modulation on a subcarrier frequency of 3.57 to 4.43 megahertz , depending on the standard in many european countries , s-video was less common because of the dominance of scart connectors , which were present on televisions until the advent of hdmi other connector variants include seven-pin locking '' dub '' connectors used on many professional s-vhs machines , and dual '' y '' and '' c '' bnc connectors , often used for s-video patch panels early y/c video monitors often used phono ( rca connector ) that were switchable between y/c and composite video input 65px the 8-pin mini-din connector is used in some ati radeon video cards image : pseudo minidin-9 diagram.png 65px 9-pin connectors are used in graphics systems that feature the ability to input video as well as output it in the latter case , it becomes all too easy to misalign the plug when inserting it with consequent damage to the small pins
