therefore , the purpose of exposure adjustment ( and/or lighting adjustment ) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film , so that 'significant ' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film 's useful exposure range in this case , adjusting the camera 's exposure settings ( which only applies changes to the whole image , not selectively to parts of the image ) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights ; it can not bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time a photograph may be described as overexposed when it has a loss of highlight detail , that is , when important bright parts of an image are '' washed out '' or effectively all white , known as '' blown-out highlights '' or '' clipped whites '' for most cameras , this means using an on-board ttl light meter aperture priority ( commonly abbreviated as a , or av for aperture value ) mode gives the photographer manual control of the aperture , whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the ttl meter the purpose of an exposure meter is to estimate the subject 's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone in order to do this it has to make a number of assumptions which , under certain circumstances , will be wrong an appropriate exposure for a photograph is determined by the sensitivity of the medium used for photographic film , sensitivity is referred to as film speed and is measured on a scale published by the international organization for standardization ( iso ) faster film , that is , film with a higher iso rating , requires less exposure to make a readable image the true characteristic of most photographic emulsions is not actually linear ( see sensitometry ) , but it is close enough over the exposure range of about 1 second to 1/1000 of a second this characteristic is known as reciprocity failure digital cameras can achieve similar results ( high dynamic range ) by combining several different exposures ( varying shutter or diaphragm ) made in quick succession a loss of highlights in a photograph is usually undesirable , but in some cases can be considered to '' enhance '' appeal areas of a photo where information is lost due to extreme darkness are described as '' crushed blacks ''
