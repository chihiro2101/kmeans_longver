alkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of olefins some stoichiometric terminal oxidants that have been employed in these catalytic reactions include potassium chlorate , hydrogen peroxide ( milas hydroxylation ) , n-methylmorpholine n-oxide ( nmo , upjohn dihydroxylation ) , tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( tbhp ) , and potassium ferricyanide ( k 3 fe ( cn ) 6 ) a 3+2 -cycloaddition with the alkene ( 3 ) gives the cyclic intermediate 4 2004 wiley-vch verlag gmbh & co 2+2 vs 3+2 debate corey published a slightly different variant of this reaction and suggested that the reaction most likely proceeded via a 3+2 cycloaddition of oso 4 with the alkene to directly generate the osmylate ester aciee 1993 , 32 , 1329 additionally both sharpless and corey showed that the active catalyst possesses a u-shaped chiral binding pocket in the october issue of the same year , however , sharpless also published the results of another study conducted in collaboration with ken houk and singleton which provided conclusive evidence for the 3+2 mechanism ) for the oxidation of terminal olefins in the example shown below , the para-methoxybenzoyl substituent serves primarily as a source of steric bulk to allow the catalyst to differentiate the two faces of the alkene
