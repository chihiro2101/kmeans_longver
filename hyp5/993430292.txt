they can also be removed manually with a high degree of assurance from secure systems by well established covert channel analysis strategies computer security technology planning study ( james p the tcsec ( tcsec ) was a set of criteria , now deprecated , that had been established by the national computer security center , an agency managed by the united states ' national security agency timing channels - perform operations that affect the '' real response time observed '' by the receiver the detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users port knocking makes it significant handel and maxwell t sandford ii ( 2005 ) they employ the osi model as a basis for their development in which they characterize system elements having potential to be used for data hiding besides suggesting the use of the reserved fields of protocols headers ( that are easily detectable ) at higher network layers , they also propose the possibility of timing channels involving csma/cd manipulation at the physical layer the covertly communicating parties are the transmitter and the wiretapper the covert information according to girling can be communicated through any of following obvious ways : by observing the addresses as approached by the transmitter the scenario transmits covert information through a '' when-is-sent ‚Äù strategy therefore termed as timing covert channel assuming block of various sizes are transmitted on the lan , software overhead is computed on average and novel time evaluation is used to estimate the bandwidth ( capacity ) of covert channels are also presented the work paves the way for future research rowland provides a proof of concept as well as practical encoding and decoding techniques for exploitation of covert channels using the tcp/ip protocol suite moreover , the usages of sequence number field as well as the acknowledgment field can not be made specific to the ascii coding of english language alphabet as proposed , since both fields take into account the receipt of data bytes pertaining to specific network packet ( s )
