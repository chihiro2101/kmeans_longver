the book absolute or relative motion ? ( 1896 ) by benedict friedländer and his brother immanuel contained ideas similar to mach 's principle mach 's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be relational theory this thought experiment demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space ( represented here by the earth 's reference frame , or better , the distant stars ) instead , when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced , this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space what is certain is that einstein interpreted mach 's passage in the former way , originating a long-lasting debate although einstein was intrigued and inspired by mach 's principle , einstein 's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of general relativity because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply , what exactly is meant by '' mach 's principle '' in general relativity is even less clear than in newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of mach 's principle are possible , some being considered more strongly machian than others we assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity , construct a large spherical shell of mass , and set it spinning in that background as for the statement that '' inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies '' , this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect the equations for an individual slice are elliptic partial differential equations in the context of an asymptotically flat spacetime , the boundary conditions are given at infinity a stronger form of mach 's principle applies in wheeler–mach–einstein spacetimes , which require spacetime to be spatially compact and globally hyperbolic in such universes mach 's principle can be stated as the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum ( and possibly other information ) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe ( where '' a particular moment in the universe '' refers to a chosen cauchy surface )
