typical rectilinear lenses can be thought of as '' improved '' pinhole camera as shown , a pinhole '' lens '' is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light , ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor the virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens 's entrance pupil ; ideally , all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film ( provided the object point is in the field of view ) image : telephoto.jpg thumb the zoom lens assembly of the canon elph a camera lens may be made from a number of elements : from one , as in the box brownie 's meniscus lens , to over 20 in the more complex zooms to minimize aberration , the curvature is usually set so that the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction are equal other materials are also used , such as quartz glass , fluorite , plastics like acrylic ( plexiglass ) , and even germanium and meteorite the quality of the material , coatings , and build affect the resolution some lenses have a uv coating to keep out the ultraviolet light that could taint color aperture and focal length practical lens assemblies may also contain mechanisms to deal with measuring light , secondary apertures for flare reduction , and mechanisms to hold the aperture open until the instant of exposure to allow slr cameras to focus with a brighter image with shallower depth of field , theoretically allowing better focus accuracy long-focus lens : any lens with a focal length longer than the diagonal measure of the film or sensor but the perspective will be different guy , 2012 , p 43 the introduction many years ago of optical coatings , and advances in coating technology over the years , have resulted in major improvements , and modern high-quality zoom lenses give images of quite acceptable contrast , although zoom lenses with many elements will transmit less light than lenses made with fewer elements ( all other factors such as aperture , focal length , and coatings being equal ) the lens mount design is an important issue for compatibility between cameras and lenses guy 2012 , page 53 a few older manual focus lens mount designs , such as the leica m39 lens mount for rangefinders , m42 lens mount for early slrs , and the pentax k mount are found across multiple brands , but this is not common today guy 2012 , page 266 most large-format cameras take interchangeable lenses as well , which are usually mounted in a lensboard or on the front standard '' close-up '' or macro depending on the camera to subject distance and aperture , the depth-of-field can be very narrow , limiting the linear depth of the area that will be in focus lenses are usually stopped down to give a greater depth-of-field lenses for aerial photography fisheye lenses : extreme wide-angle lenses with an angle of view of up to 180 degrees or more , with very noticeable ( and intended ) distortion shift lenses and tilt/shift lenses ( collectively perspective control lenses ) allow special control of perspective on slr cameras by mimicking view camera movements some notable photographic optical lens designs are : angenieux retrofocus cooke triplet double-gauss goerz dagor leitz elmar rapid rectilinear zeiss sonnar zeiss planar zeiss tessar
