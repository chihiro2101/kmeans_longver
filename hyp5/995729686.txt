trading group theory for randomness this machine is potentially more powerful than an ordinary np interaction protocol , and the certificates are no less practical to verify , since bpp algorithms are considered as abstracting practical computation ( see bpp ) public coin protocol versus private coin protocol in the same conference where babai defined his proof system for ma , shafi goldwasser , silvio micali and charles rackoff extended abstract published a paper defining the interactive proof system ipf ( n ) in arthur–merlin protocols , babai defined a similar class amf ( n ) which allowed f ( n ) rounds , but he put one extra condition on the machine : the verifier must show the prover all the random bits it uses in its computation the essential problem with public coins is that if the prover wishes to maliciously convince the verifier to accept a string which is not in the language , it seems like the verifier might be able to thwart its plans if it can hide its internal state from it lászló babai and shlomo moran if we allow the probabilistic verifier machine and the all-powerful prover to interact for a polynomial number of rounds , we get the class of problems called ip journal of the acm , volume 39 , issue 4 , p.869–877 overcame this in their 1988 '' multi prover interactive proofs : how to remove intractability assumptions '' , which defines a variant of ip called mip in which there are two independent provers ben-or , shafi goldwasser , j kilian , and a multi prover interactive proofs : how to remove intractability assumptions fortnow , and c sanjeev arora , c sudan , and m proceedings of the 33rd ieee symposium on foundations of computer science , pp
