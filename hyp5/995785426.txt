collins dictionary of the english language , london , 1986 , p.520 the sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a tenant into the possession of the lord in feudal england , escheat referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee ( or '' fief '' ) died without an heir or committed a felony where no legal heir existed , the logic of the situation was that the fief had ceased to exist as a legal entity , since being tenantless no one was living who had been enfeoffed with the land , and the land was thus technically owned by either the crown or the immediate overlord ( where the fee had been subinfeudated by the tenant-in-chief to a mesne lord , and perhaps the process of subinfeudation had been continued by a lower series of mesne-lords ) as ultimus heres pollock and maitland , history of english law , vol 1 , pp if the person was executed for felony , his heirs were attainder , i.e were ineligible to inherit in most common-law jurisdictions , this type of escheat has been abolished outright , for example in the united states under article 3 ยง 3 of the united states constitution , which states that attainders for treason do not give rise to posthumous forfeiture , or '' corruption of blood '' if there was any doubt , the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to the king 's court where it would be settled , ensuring that not one day 's revenue would be lost a company is required to file unclaimed property reports with its state annually and , in some jurisdictions , to make a good-faith effort to find the owners of their dormant accounts usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in ' ( transferred to ) the official receiver or trustee in bankruptcy the bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt 's legal property , and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate , so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the crown in demesne this had the consequence that freeholds which escheated to the crown ceased to be registrable the problem was noted by the law commission in their report '' land registration for the twenty-first century '' escheats are performed on a revocable basis according to sec rule 17 cfr 240.17f-1 : transfer agents are obligated by the sec to report to commission ( specifically to its designee ; the sec 's securities information system ) anytime a certificate is known to be lost or missing for at least 2 days
