despite being pyroelectric , novel materials such as boron aluminum nitride ( baln ) and boron gallium nitride ( bgan ) have zero piezoelectric response for strain along the c-axis at certain compositions , the two properties being closely related as a consequence there are no electric dipole equivalents of bar magnets because the intrinsic dipole moment is neutralized by '' free '' electric charge that builds up on the surface by internal conduction or from the ambient atmosphere pyroelectric materials can be used as infrared and millimeter wavelength radiation detectors caley and john f.c richards , theophrastus : on stones ( columbus , ohio : ohio state university , 1956 ) , page 51 , paragraph 28 of the original text : '' it smaragdos is remarkable in its powers , and so is the lyngourion i.e 2 ( new york , new york : gordon and breach , 1974 ) , page 96 in 1717 louis lemery noticed , as schmidt had , that small scraps of non-conducting material were first attracted to tourmaline , but then repelled by it once they contacted the stone aepinus ( 1756 ) '' memoire concernant quelques nouvelles experiences électriques remarquables '' memoir concerning some remarkable new electrical experiments , histoire de l'académie royale des sciences et des belles lettres ( berlin ) , vol and woldemar voigt in 1897 w only 10 of the 32 point groups are polar all polar crystals are pyroelectric , so the ten polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes piezoelectric crystal classes : 1 , 2 , m , 222 , mm2 , 4 , -4 , 422 , 4mm , -42m , 3 , 32 , 3m , 6 , -6 , 622 , 6mm , -62m , 23 , -43m pyroelectric : 1 , 2 , m , mm2 , 3 , 3m , 4 , 4mm , 6 , 6mm the ferroelectric effect is exhibited by materials which possess an electric polarization in the absence of an externally applied electric field such that the polarization can be reversed if the electric field is reversed pyroelectricity should not be confused with thermoelectricity : in a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity , the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another , and the result is a temporary voltage across the crystal the most important example is gallium nitride , a semiconductor one group calculated that a pyroelectric in an ericsson cycle could reach 50 % of carnot efficiency , while a different study found a material that could , in theory , reach 84-92 % of carnot efficiency ( these efficiency values are for the pyroelectric itself , ignoring losses from heating and cooling the thin film , other heat-transfer losses , and all other losses elsewhere in the system ) this is known as pyroelectric fusion .
