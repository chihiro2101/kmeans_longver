standard anatomy and zoology terms of location have been developed , usually based on latin and greek words , to enable all biological and medical scientists , veterinarians , doctors and anatomists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their organs , even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive one reason is that humans have a different neuraxis and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs , humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position , which is standing up with arms outstretched thus , what is on '' top '' of a human is the head , whereas the '' top '' of a dog may be its back , and the '' top '' of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side combined terms were once generally , hyphenated , but the modern tendency is to omit the hyphen the sagittal planes , which are to the median plane the horizontal plane , also known as the transverse plane , which is perpendicular to the other two planes ( paramecium caudatum , above , and stentor roeselii , below ) the axes of the body are lines drawn about which an organism is roughly symmetrical anatomical axes.svg anatomical axes in a human , similar for other orthograde posture vertebrates anatomical directions and axes.jpg anatomical axes and directions in a fish long and short axis.png spheroid or near-spheroid organs such as testis may be measured by '' long '' and '' short '' axis several terms are commonly seen and used as prefixes : sub- is used to indicate something that is beneath , or something that is subordinate to or lesser than the genitals are medial to the legs for example , the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg bilateral : on both sides of the body thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal superficial describes something near the outer surface of the organism the ventral surface refers to the front , or lower side , of an organism to describe how close to the head of an animal something is , three distinct terms are used : rostral describes something situated toward the oral or nasal region , or in the case of the brain , toward the tip of the frontal lobe for example , in horses , the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head mcgraw-hill 2003 miller , s they are used in anatomy , surface anatomy , surgery , and radiology for example , structures at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra may be abbreviated as '' c4 '' , at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra '' t4 '' , and at the level of the third lumbar vertebra '' l3 '' for example , structures may be described relative to the anterior superior iliac spine , the medial malleolus or the medial epicondyle this is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw , some different relationships require special terminology as well ; for example , teeth also can be rotated , and in such contexts terms like '' anterior '' or '' lateral '' become ambiguous for example , the top of a dog 's paw is its dorsal surface ; the underside , either the palmar ( on the forelimb ) or the plantar ( on the hindlimb ) surface this confusion can arise because the forearm can pronate and supinate structures closer to the radius are radial , structures closer to the ulna are ulnar , and structures relating to both bones are referred to as radioulnar anteversion and retroversion are complementary terms describing an anatomical structure that is rotated forwards ( towards the front of the body ) or backwards ( towards the back of the body ) , relative to some other position two related terms , '' abaxial '' and '' adaxial '' , refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism , respectively luminal : on the—hollow—inside of an organ 's lumen ( body cavity or tubular structure ) ; adluminal is towards , abluminal is away from the lumen parietal : pertaining to the wall of a body cavity an antenna with a terminal sensory hair '' for example , the stomach is a viscus within the abdominal cavity , and visceral pain refers to pain originating from internal organs . specific animals and other organisms some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates ; for example proximal , meaning '' near '' refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body , and distal , meaning '' standing away from '' is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment 662px-anatomical-directions.png anatomical terms of location in a dog anatomical-directions-kangaroo.svg anatomical terms of location in a kangaroo anatomical directions and axes.jpg anatomical terms of location in a fish . asymmetrical and spherical organisms the long or longitudinal axis is defined by points at the opposite ends of the organism jpg thumb right a cluster of venus ' flower basket , showing the apical-basal axes unlike vertebrates , cnidarians have no other distinctive axes however , some biradially symmetrical ctenophora do have distinct '' tentacular '' and '' pharyngeal '' axes ruppert et al most spiders have eight eyes in four pairs file : palystes superciliosus male anterior 2012 03 04 3452.jpg aspects of spider anatomy ;
