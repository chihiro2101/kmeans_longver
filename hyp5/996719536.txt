when a digital image is viewed , a reconstruction is performed by a display or printer device , and by the eyes and the brain spatial anti-aliasing techniques avoid such poor pixelizations '' time filter technical explanation '' like the video camera , most sampling schemes are periodic ; that is , they have a characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space sometimes aliasing is used intentionally on signals with no low-frequency content , called bandpass signals when sampling a function at frequency & nbsp ; is met for the highest frequency component of the original signal , then it is met for all the frequency components , a condition called the nyquist criterion a filter chosen in anticipation of a certain sample frequency is called an anti-aliasing filter most sampled signals are not simply stored and reconstructed this unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal this aliasing is visible in images such as posters with lenticular printing : if they have low angular resolution , then as one moves past them , say from left-to-right , the 2d image does not initially change ( so it appears to move left ) , then as one moves to the next angular image , the image suddenly changes ( so it jumps right ) â€“ and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image ( and , for frequency , the speed of the viewer 's lateral movement ) , which is the angular aliasing of the 4d light field the sawtooths alternate between bandlimited ( non-aliased ) sawtooths and aliased sawtooths and the sampling rate is 22,05 & nbsp ; khz
