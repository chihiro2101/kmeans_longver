gustavson ( chair ) and david v james was a major contributor for writing the specifications including the executable c-code dolphin interconnect solutions implemented a pci and pci-express connected derivative of sci that provides non-coherent shared memory access the concept of folding rings can also be applied to the torus topologies to avoid any long connection segments a transition from 1 to 0 occurs 1 ( for echoes ) or 4 symbols before the packet end packets without a valid destination address will be removed when passing the scrubber for the second time to avoid filling the ring with packets that would otherwise circulate indefinitely modern processors with caches that are more than two orders of magnitude faster than main memory would not perform anywhere near optimal without more sophisticated methods for data consistency bus based systems use eavesdropping ( snooping ) methods since buses are inherently broadcast instead , sci uses a distributed directory-based cache coherence protocol with a linked list of nodes containing processors that share a particular cache line the distributed directory is scalable gustavson led a group called the scalable coherent interface and serial express users , developers , and manufacturers association and maintained a web site for the technology starting in 1996 a series of workshops were held through 1999 in january 1998 , the sldram corporation was formed to hold patents on an attempt to define a new memory interface that was related to another working group called serialexpress or local area memory port in 1999 a series of papers was published as a book on sci
