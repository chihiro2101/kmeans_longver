the understanding of the concept of second messengers , and in particular the role of cyclic nucleotides and their ability to relay physiological signals to a cell , has its origins in the research of glycogen metabolism by carl and gerty cori , for which they were awarded a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1947 while investigating the action of adrenaline on glycogenolysis the next year , sutherland and walter wosilait reported that inorganic phosphate is released when the enzyme liver phosphorylase is inactivated ; but when it is activated , it incorporates a phosphate by the end of the decade , the presence of two types of intramembrane receptors was understood : rs ( which stimulates cyclase ) and ri ( which inhibits cyclase ) the cyclic portion refers to the two single bonds between the phosphate group and the ribose the two most well-studied cyclic nucleotides are cyclic amp ( camp ) and cyclic gmp ( cgmp ) , while cyclic cmp ( ccmp ) and cyclic ump ( cump ) are less understood these three components are connected so that the nitrogenous base is attached to the first carbon of ribose ( 1 ’ carbon ) , and the phosphate group is attached to the 5 ’ carbon of ribose the atom numbering convention is used to identify the carbons and nitrogens within a cyclic nucleotide control of intracellular concentrations is maintained through a series of enzymatic reactions involving several families of proteins cyclic nucleotides can be found in many different types of eukaryotic cells , including photo-receptor rods and cones , smooth muscle cells and liver cells there is also data to support a synergistic binding effect amongst multiple cyclic nucleotides , with ccmp lowering the effective concentration ( ec 50 ) of camp for activation of protein kinase a ( pka ) cyclic nucleotides participate in many physiological responses , including receptor-effector coupling , down-regulation of drug responsiveness , protein-kinase cascades , and transmembrane signal transduction this releases camp into the cell interior , where it stimulates a protein kinase called cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase in addition , they potentially activate cyclic cng channels in : pineal gland light sensitivity , sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ ( which is involved in the detection of pheromones ) , taste receptor cells , cell signaling in sperm , airway epithelium cells , gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) -secreting neuronal cell line , and renal collecting duct system . pathway mutations and related diseases phosphodiesterases , principle regulators of cnmp degradation , are often targets for therapeutics
