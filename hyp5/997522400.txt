s-vhs improves luminance ( luma ) resolution by increasing luminance bandwidth notice also that the luminance modulator bandwidth is increased : in contrast to standard vhs ' frequencies of 3.8 mhz ( synch tip ) to 4.8 mhz ( peak white ) , s-vhs uses 5.4 mhz synch tip and 7.4 mhz peak white this feature is useful for viewing s-vhs camcorder recordings which used either the full-size s-vhs videotape cassette or the smaller vhs-c videotape cassette to get the most benefit from s-vhs , a direct video connection to the monitor or tv is required , ideally via an s-video connectors and/or s-video enabled scart these have a different oxide media formulation for higher magnetic coercivity jvc also introduced an s-vhs et ( super-vhs expansion technology ) system on its s-vhs consumer decks , allowing the use of normal vhs tapes for s-vhs recording , by slightly modifying the s-vhs recording specs while still retaining compatibility so that s-vhs et tapes could be played with non-et s-vhs vcrs likewise , s-vhs rentals and movie sales did very poorly it was more popular for the amateur video industry , as it allowed for at least second generation copies at reasonable quality ( necessary for editing ) for most of these stations , while the u-matics that they had been using were being phased out , but digital video was still years away , s-vhs was used to record from the composite setups that were still in place for u-matic production digital camcorders generally outperform s-vhs-c units in most technical aspects : audio/video quality , recording time , lossless duplication , and form-factor however , chroma performance was far less spectacular , as neither s-vhs nor ed-beta exceeded 0.4 megahertz or ~30 tvl maximum , whereas ntsc broadcast has a chroma resolution of ~120 tvl , and dvd has a chroma resolution of ~240 tvl s-vhs was used in some tv stations for inexpensive '' on the spot '' camcorder capture of breaking news , however it was not suitable for multi-generational ( studio ) use market , the mainstream consumer market had largely ignored the release of s-vhs nevertheless , it is clear to all that by the time of ed-beta 's introduction , vhs had already won a decisive victory , and no amount of competition on behalf of ed-beta could regain the home video market use for digital audio , a 120 min s-vhs cassette held 40 minutes of eight-track audio studer produced the v-eight ( manufuctured and sold by alesis as the m20 ) and the v-twenty-four digital multitrack recorders
