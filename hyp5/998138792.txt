in 2001 , the us national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) revised its list of approved modes of operation by including aes as a block cipher and adding ctr mode in sp800-38a , recommendation for block cipher modes of operation other confidentiality modes exist which have not been approved by nist they therefore began to supply modes which combined confidentiality and data integrity into a single cryptographic primitive ( an encryption algorithm ) initialization vector ( iv ) for most block cipher modes it is important that an initialization vector is never reused under the same key , i.e it must be a cryptographic nonce in cbc mode , the iv must be unpredictable ( random or pseudorandom ) at encryption time ; in particular , the ( previously ) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the iv for the next message is insecure ( for example , this method was used by ssl 2.0 ) for cfb-8 , an all-zero iv and an all-zero plaintext , causes 1/256 of keys to generate no encryption , plaintext is returned as ciphertext for ofb-8 , using all zero initialization vector will generate no encryption for 1/256 of keys schneier and ferguson suggest two possibilities , both simple : append a byte with value 128 ( hex 80 ) , followed by as many zero bytes as needed to fill the last block , or pad the last block with n bytes all with value n examples of such modes are , , iapm ( mode ) ( iapm ) , ocb , eax , cwc , ccm , and gcm authenticated encryption modes are classified as single-pass modes or double-pass modes . synthetic initialization vector ( siv ) s2v is a keyed hash is based on cmac , and the input to the function is : additional authenticated data ( zero , one or many aad fields are supported ) plaintext authentication key ( k the construction is defined in rfc 8452 many modes of operation have been defined some of these are described below if resistance to random error is desirable , error-correcting codes should be applied to the ciphertext before transmission other modes and other cryptographic primitives some have been accepted , fully described ( even standardized ) , and are in use reusing an iv with the same key in ctr , gcm or ofb mode results in xoring the same keystream with two or more plaintexts , a clear misuse of a stream , with a catastrophic loss of security deterministic authenticated encryption modes such as the nist key wrap algorithm and the siv ( rfc 5297 ) aead mode do not require an iv as an input , and return the same ciphertext and authentication tag every time for a given plaintext and key block ciphers can also be used in other cryptographic protocols
