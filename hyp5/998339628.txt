when the cytoskeleton was first introduced , it was thought to be an uninteresting gel-like substance that helped organelles stay in place initially , it was thought that the cytoskeleton was exclusive to eukaryotes but in 1992 it was discovered to be present in prokaryotes as well eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments : microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments microtubules are composed of tubulin and are 25 & nbsp ; nm in diameter research into neurodegeneration such as parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , huntington 's disease , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) indicate that the cytoskeleton is affected in these diseases parkinson 's disease is marked by the degradation of neurons , resulting in tremors , rigidity , and other non-motor symptoms research has shown that microtubule assembly and stability in the cytoskeleton is compromised causing the neurons to degrade over time microfilaments , also known as actin filaments , are composed of linear polymers of g-actin proteins , and generate force when the growing ( plus ) end of the filament pushes against a barrier , such as the cell membrane in combination with proteins and desmosomes , the intermediate filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell vimentin intermediate filaments are in general present in mesenchymal cells they have a very dynamic behavior , binding gtp for polymerization they are commonly organized by the centrosome in nine triplet sets ( star-shaped ) , they form the centrioles , and in nine doublets oriented about two additional microtubules ( wheel-shaped ) , they form cilia and flagella there are two types of cilia : & nbsp ; motile & nbsp ; and & nbsp ; non-motile cilia and penrose , r physics of life reviews 2014 , 11 , 39-78 in yeast cells , they build scaffolding to provide structural support during cell division and compartmentalize parts of the cell recent research in human cells suggests that septins build cages around bacterial pathogens , immobilizing the harmful microbes and preventing them from invading other cells the cytoskeleton was once thought to be a feature only of eukaryote cells , but homologues to all the major proteins of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes although the evolutionary relationships are so distant that they are not obvious from protein sequence comparisons alone , the similarity of their three-dimensional structures and similar functions in maintaining cell shape and polarity provides strong evidence that the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytoskeletons are truly homologous prokaryotic actin-like proteins , such as mreb , are involved in the maintenance of cell shape tubulin-like , actin-like , walker a cytoskeletal atpases ( waca-proteins ) , and intermediate filaments actin-like proteins are actin in eukaryotes and mreb , ftsa in prokaryotes eukaryotes ) are the lamins , keratins , vimentin , neurofilaments , and desmin
