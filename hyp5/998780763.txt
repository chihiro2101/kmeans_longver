the autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway ; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) , in cranial sensory ganglia : the geniculate , petrosal and nodose ganglia , appended respectively to cranial nerves vii , ix and x the sensory part of the latter reaches the spinal column at certain spinal segments lippincott , 2 ed some typical actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are listed below promotes a fight-or-flight response , corresponds with arousal and energy generation , and inhibits digestion diverts blood flow away from the gastro-intestinal ( gi ) tract and skin via vasoconstriction blood flow to skeletal muscles and the lungs is enhanced ( by as much as 1200 % in the case of skeletal muscles ) dilates bronchioles of the lung through circulating epinephrine , which allows for greater alveolar oxygen exchange increases heart rate and the contractility of cardiac cells ( myocytes ) , thereby providing a mechanism for enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles dilates pupils and relaxes the ciliary muscle to the lens , allowing more light to enter the eye and enhances far vision provides vasodilation for the coronary vessels of the heart constricts all the intestinal sphincters and the urinary sphincter inhibits peristalsis stimulates orgasm they are also responsible for stimulating sexual arousal it has been described as '' the second brain of the human body '' at the effector organs , sympathetic ganglionic neurons release noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) , along with other cotransmitters such as atp , to act on adrenergic receptors , with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla : acetylcholine is the preganglionic neurotransmitter for both divisions of the ans , as well as the postganglionic neurotransmitter of parasympathetic neurons at the adrenal medulla , there is no postsynaptic neuron in 1665 , willis used the terminology , and in 1900 , langley used the term , defining the two divisions as the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems caffeine is a bioactive compound found in commonly consumed beverages such as coffee , tea , and sodas furthermore , this study found that recovery after intense exercise was slower when caffeine was consumed prior to exercise this finding is indicative of caffeine 's tendency to inhibit parasympathetic activity in non-habitual consumers it is important to note that the data supporting increased parasympathetic activity in the supine position was derived from an experiment involving participants between the ages of 25 and 30 who were considered healthy and sedentary
