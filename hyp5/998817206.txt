the history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry , and the use of '' fingerprinting '' methods such as immune assays , gel electrophoresis and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins after the 1970s , nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal rna sequences , the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life other types of mutations modify larger segments of dna and can cause duplications , insertions , deletions , inversions , and translocations transitions ( a ↔ g or c ↔ t ) are more common than transversions ( purine ( adenine or guanine ) ) ↔ pyrimidine ( cytosine or thymine , or in rna , uracil ) ) and are less likely to alter amino acid sequences of proteins mutation rates for single nucleotide sites for most organisms are very low , roughly 10 −9 to 10 −8 per site per generation , though some viruses have higher mutation rates on the order of 10 −6 per site per generation among these mutations , some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift , and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection gene conversion is often responsible for homogenizing sequences of duplicate genes over long time periods , reducing nucleotide divergence '' nearly neutral '' variants whose selection coefficient is close to a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size will also be affected by chance as well as by selection and mutation the principles of population genetics apply similarly to all types of selection , though in fact each may produce distinct effects due to clustering of genes with different functions in different parts of the genome , or due to different properties of genes in particular functional classes explanations for the so-called paradox are two-fold secondly , the number of genes is not necessarily indicative of the number of developmental stages or tissue types in an organism genome size , independent of gene content , correlates poorly with most physiological traits and many eukaryotes , including mammals , harbor very large amounts of repetitive dna birds , unlike humans , produce nucleated red blood cells , and larger nuclei lead to lower levels of oxygen transport chromosome number and organization the ant myrmecia pilosula has only a single pair of chromosomes whereas the adders-tongue fern ophioglossum reticulatum has up to 1260 chromosomes . gene content and distribution some organisms , such as most bacteria , drosophila , and arabidopsis have particularly compact genomes with little repetitive content or non-coding dna mitochondrial and chloroplast dna varies across taxa , but membrane-bound proteins , especially electron transport chain constituents are most often encoded in the organelle new genes arise from several different genetic mechanisms including gene duplication , de novo origination , retrotransposition , chimeric gene formation , recruitment of non-coding sequence , and gene truncation melanogaster genome from noncoding dna similar de novo origin of genes has been also shown in other organisms such as yeast , rice and humans . in vitro molecular evolution experiments 10^14 sequences ) to be followed in a single day of experimentation these studies were accompanied by theoretical developments and simulations involving rna folding and replication kinetics that elucidated the importance of the correlation structure between distance in sequence space and fitness changes ref , including the role of neutral networks and structural ensembles in evolutionary optimisation about their correct scientific classification or taxonomy from the point of view of evolutionary biology the driving forces of evolution while acknowledging that many mutations are neutral , selectionists attribute changes in the frequencies of neutral alleles to linkage disequilibrium with other loci that are under selection , rather than to random genetic drift the nearly neutral theory expanded the neutralist perspective , suggesting that several mutations are nearly neutral , which means both random drift and natural selection is relevant to their dynamics evolution of proteins is studied by comparing the sequences and structures of proteins from many organisms representing distinct evolutionary clades whereas , homologous proteins encoded by the genome of a single species are called paralogs using the amino acid sequences of hemoglobin and cytochrome c from multiple species , scientists were able to derive estimations of protein evolution rates each protein has its own rate , and that rate is constant across phylogenies ( i.e at the end of the 1960s , two groups of scientists—kimura ( 1968 ) and king and jukes ( 1969 ) —independently proposed that a majority of the evolutionary changes observed in proteins were neutral . discordance with morphological evolution phenotypic plasticity , multiple life-cycle stages ) other journals dedicated to molecular evolution include journal of molecular evolution and molecular
