phrenology had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain , but broca 's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship , and has been described as '' epoch-making '' and '' pivotal '' to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science the coining of the term '' neurolinguistics '' is attributed to edith crowell trager , henri hecaen and alexandr luria , in the late 1940s and 1950s ; luria 's book '' problems in neurolinguistics '' is likely the first book with neurolinguistics in the title harry whitaker popularized neurolinguistics in the united states in the 1970s , founding the journal '' brain and language '' in 1974 hagoort , peter ; colin m brown ; lee osterhout ( 1999 ) '' the neurocognition of syntactic processing weisler ( 1999 ) , p '' the cognitive neuroscience of language '' in brown & hagoort the neurocognition of language ping li , jennifer legault , kaitlyn a such techniques include pet and fmri in addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations , hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain 's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time , as a function of linguistic exposure gb 9216383 , uk patent office , 1992 , and damasio , a san diego , ca , us : academic press , composed of similar parts ) it is a method of exciting or interrupting brain activity in a specific and controlled location , and thus is able to imitate aphasic symptoms while giving the researcher more control over exactly which parts of the brain will be examined few neurolinguistic studies to date have used tms ; direct cortical stimulation and cortical recording ( recording brain activity using electrodes placed directly on the brain ) have been used with macaque to make predictions about the behavior of human brains the lexical decision task involves subjects seeing or hearing an isolated word and answering whether or not it is a real word . grammaticality judgment , acceptability judgment crain , stephen , luisa meroni , and utako minai '' university of maryland at college park another related form of experiment is the double-task experiment , in which a subject must perform an extra task ( such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables ) while responding to linguistic stimuli ; this kind of experiment has been used to investigate the use of working memory in language processing
