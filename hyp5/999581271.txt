the latin chronicle was written by a mozarab christian none of them predates the mid-ninth century , the date of the earliest , the futūh miṣr of ibn ʿabd al-ḥakam ( c.803 & ndash ; 71 ) , which was composed in egypt ( 1858 ) , history of the conquest of spain ( göttingen : w kaestner ) , pp descendant of the goth i.e thompson , and kenneth baxter wolf are sceptical of the arabic sources and rely more on the mozarabic chronicle the nature of his accession on the death of wittiza from natural causes or through his assassination , is not clear from the sources archaeological evidence and two surviving lists of kings show that one achila ii ruled in the northeast of the kingdom at this time , but his relationship to roderic is unknown berber forces had probably been harassing the peninsula by sea since the conquest of tangiers in 705/6 ignacio olagüe ( 2004 1974 ) , la revolución islámica en occidente ( editorial plurabelle ) , 274 & ndash ; 75 12 , n° 1 , p ṭāriq landed on 28 april 711 according to the mozarabic chronicle , mūsā crossed the gaditanum fretum ( strait of cádiz ) with a large force in 711 in the buildings of justinian of procopius the term gaditanum fretum is synonymous with straits of gibraltar and need not imply that mūsā landed at cádiz ( ancient gades ) itself roger collins ( 1986 ) , the basques ( londong : blackwell publishing ) , 97 there is also the record of a byzantine attack on southern iberia that was repulsed by theudimer some years before the fall of the visigothic kingdom thompson , 250 , is explicit that nothing is known of the context of these byzantine raids kenneth baxter wolf , ed medieval texts in translation if this discrepancy is solved by preferring the chronicler 's order to his dating , then the battle occurred in 712 and the fall of toledo later that same year a more rough dating is between 19 and 23 july according to david levering lewis , the battle took place on 19 july 711 the later arab accounts , most of them generating from al-ḥakam 's , also place the battle near medina sidonia , '' near the lake '' or wadilakka ( river lakka ) , often identified as the guadalete river , la janda lake , for this , see glick , 31 ( that is , their associated valleys ) thomas hodgkin , probably following rodrigo jiménez de rada , placed the battle at jerez de la frontera rodrigo states that the battle took place ad fluvium qui guadalete dicitur , prope assidonam quae nunc xeres dicitur : at the river called guadalete , beside sidonia , now called xeres ( quoted in shaw , 223 n42 ) this number is outrageously high ; it complements the figure of 187,000 for the muslims provided by the ad sebastianum version of the chronicle of alfonso iii there could thus have been as many as 12,000 muslim fighters at the battle a small number of elite clans ( perhaps around twenty five ) , their warrior followings , the king and his personal following , and the forces that could be raised from the royal fisc constituted the troops upon which roderic could draw david lewis , 123 & ndash ; 124 this unclear passage could indicate that roderic had killed his rivals and weakened his army , ensuring defeat , or that his rivals too died in the battle or its retreat according to rafael altamira y crevea , the '' connexion between the muslims and the sons of wittiza is confirmed by all the chroniclers , and forms a trustworthy starting-point for the history of the invasion , '' cited in bachrach ( 1973 ) , 33n86 , who finds it tempting to place the muslims , the native jewry , and achila ii , whom he reckons a son of wittza , in a tripartite alliance against roderic cause of muslim victory al-maqqarī , in the breath of perfumes , places in the mouth of ṭāriq a morale-boosting address to his soldiers on the eve of battle , which closes with this exhortation to kill roderic : according to later traditions , indigenous iberian jews , progressively disenfranchised under the rule of christian monarchs and bishops , wolfram drews ( 2002 ) , '' jews as pagans ? polemical definitions of identity in visigothic spain '' , early medieval europe , 11 ( 3 ) , 189 & ndash ; 207 , provides a good overview of the treatment of the jews in spain this view was influentially expounded in english by the presbyterian reverend dykes shaw ( 1906 ) , '' the fall of the visigothic power in spain '' , the english historical review , 21:82 ( april ) , 209 & ndash ; 228 '' this is not accepted by specialists today , though it still exerts heavy influence through tertiary accounts , especially in spanish language historiography among the legends which have accrued to the history of the battle , the most prominent is that of count julian , who , in revenge for the impregnation of his daughter florinda ( the later cava rumía or doña cava ) by roderic while the young woman was being raised at the palace school , supposedly lent ṭāriq the necessary ships for launching an invasion shaw , 221 , writing in 1906 , rejects this as legend from the late ninth- and tenth-century arabic histories the outrageousness of the accusations is proportional to the chronological distance of the narrative
