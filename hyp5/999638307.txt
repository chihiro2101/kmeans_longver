color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal & ndash ; on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity , but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice on color sets the signal would be extracted , decoded back into rgb , and displayed the first broadcast using the new standard occurred on new year 's day in 1954 , when nbc broadcast the tournament of roses parade in the united states in 1960 , only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total masaru ibuka , sony 's president and co-founder , steadfastly refused to develop a system based on rca 's shadow mask design , which he considered technically deficient the resulting image was far brighter than anything the rca design could produce , and lacked the convergence problems that required constant adjustments he was unimpressed with the labs , describing the windowless basement as '' squalor '' after several thousand sets had shipped , the situation was no better , while panasonic and toshiba were in the process of introducing sets based on rca licenses susumu yoshida was sent to the u.s he also saw general electric 's '' porta-color '' design , using three guns in a row instead of a triangle , which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit miyaoka built a prototype and was astonished by how well it worked , although it had focusing problems later that week , on saturday , miyaoka was summoned to ibuka 's office while he was attempting to leave work to attend his weekly cello practice miyaoka , anxious to leave , answered yes , excused himself , and left since the guns were in-line , their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots , about doubling the lit area in practice , this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube & ndash ; the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped , resulting in shifting colors on the screen . introduction , early models the vertical wires in the aperture grille meant that the tube had to be nearly flat vertically ; this gave it a unique cylindrical look 48 the kv-1210 was introduced in limited numbers in japan in october as promised , and in the u.s early color sets intended for the uk market had a pal decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by telefunken of germany , who invented the pal color system sony won an emmy award for the trinitron in 1973 on his 84th birthday in 1992 , ibuka claimed the trinitron was his proudest product early models were generally packaged in silver cases , but with the introduction of the darker screens , sony also introduced new cases with a dark charcoal color , following a similar change in color taking place in the hi-fi world in 1990 , sony released the first hd trinitron tv set , for use with the multiple sub-nyquist sampling encoding standard ) the vtx-100es tuner and txt-100g teletext decoder '' kx-20ps1 '' the concept was to build a market similar to contemporary stereo equipment , where components from different vendors could be mixed to produce a complete system these units were paired with the vt-x5r tuner and optionally the apm-x5a speakers along with its other functions , it had video and audio inputs and outputs as well as a wideband sound-if decoded output 13 '' model that was originally sold with the macintosh ii starting in 1987 in april 1981 , they announced the sony hdvs ( hdvs ) , a suite of muse equipment including cameras , recorders , trinitron monitors and projection tvs many other companies entered the market quickly , widely copying the new silver styling as well both of these technologies have well known problems , and for some time sony explored a wide array of technologies that would improve upon them in the same way the trinitron did on the shadow mask at its peak , 20 million were made annually the trinitron design incorporates two unique features : the single-gun three-cathode picture tube , and the vertically aligned aperture grille due to the slight separation of the cathodes at the back of the tube , the three beams approach the grille at slightly different angles the main purpose of the grille is to ensure that each beam strikes only the phosphor stripes for its color , much as does a shadow mask monitors using trinitron technology have one or more thin tungsten wires running horizontally across the grille to prevent this gateway computer '' vivitron '' mag innovision '' technitron '' nec display solutions ( nec/mitsubishi ) '' diamondtron '' samsung '' hitron '' viewsonic '' sonictron '' trinitron : sony 's once unbeatable product sony trinitron explained
