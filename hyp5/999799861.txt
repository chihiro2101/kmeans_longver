summary description and example for instance , if the polarization of two of the photons are measured and determined to be rotated +45° from horizontal , then local hidden variable theory predicts that the polarization of the third photon will also be +45° from horizontal for any one signal which has been detected by a in one particular trial , b must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial , and c must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial ; and vice versa for any one trial j it may be consequently distinguished in which particular channels signals were detected and counted by a , b , and c together , in this particular trial j ; and correlation numbers such as : p ( a↑ ) ( b « ) ( c ◊ ) ( j ) ( n j ( a↑ ) − n j ( a↓ ) ) ( n j ( b « ) − n j ( b » ) ) ( n j ( c ◊ ) − n j ( c ♦ ) ) can be evaluated in each trial trial s for instance would be characterized by a 's setting a 2 , b 's setting b 2 , and c 's settings c 2 ; another trial , r , would be characterized by a 's setting a 2 , b 's setting b 2 , and c 's settings c 1 , and so on the notion of local hidden variables is now introduced by considering the following question : can the individual detection outcomes and corresponding counts as obtained by any one observer , e.g this is the statistical independence assumption ( also assumed in bell 's theorem and commonly known as '' free will '' assumption ) taking the product of the last three equations , and noting that a ( a 1 , λ ) a ( a 1 , λ ) 1 , b ( b 1 , λ ) b ( b 1 , λ ) 1 , and c ( c 1 , λ ) c ( c 1 , λ ) 1 , yields : a ( a 2 , λ ) b ( b 2 , λ ) c ( c 2 , λ ) 1 in contradiction to the first equation ; 1 ≠ −1
